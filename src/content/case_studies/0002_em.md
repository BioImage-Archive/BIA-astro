Sjors Scheres, research leader at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) and author of [RELION](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page), a widely used processing software for electron microscopy, was an early user of EMPIAR, both as submitter and reuser of data. 

_"EMPIAR is very useful: it provides us with new data to test and develop our algorithms. Relying only on in-house data provides a very limited view but, because EMPIAR contains data from different sources, it allows us a much wider exposure to tune our algorithms."_, explains Scheres. _"Not having it would slow us down."_

EMPIAR hosts the data used for RELION tutorials and benchmarks. Scheres was also involved in a EM community [map challenge](http://challenges.emdataresource.org/?q=2015_map_challenge), in which participants downloaded datasets from EMPIAR and processed them using different workflows and software to compare results.
