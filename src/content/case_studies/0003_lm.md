Research institutes often find it difficult to store large datasets and make them publicly available. For this reason, Chris Bakal, research team leader at the Institute for Cancer Research, submitted data from his research to IDR. 

_"We want people to be able to reproduce our research results and re-analyze our data in their own way. For that, it is essential that people have access to the raw data. Databases such as IDR are an easy place to store it"_, says Bakal, who deposited both image and quantitative screening data from his research in IDR. _"Our research is supported by grants and public funds so it is important that our results are shared with the scientific community."_
