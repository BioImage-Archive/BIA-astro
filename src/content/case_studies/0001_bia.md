Dr. Katrín Möller, a post-doctoral researcher at Biomedical Center of the University of Iceland, recently published a paper in eLIFE [A role for the centrosome in regulating the rate of neuronal efferocytosis by microglia in vivo](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82094). Katrín also deposited the [imaging data supporting her publication](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/studies/S-BIAD564) in the BioImage Archive. You can read more about this in an article by Euro-BioImaging [here](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/news/neuroscience-new-microglia-dataset-available-on-bioimage-archive/).

_"I was wondering where to store my data when I learned about the BioImage Archive at the BNMI Symposium from Euro-BioImaging project manager Johanna Bischof. It’s great to have a place to put life-sciences microscopy data."_, says Katrín, _"“The BioImage Archive really is a fantastic effort. Despite the hard work, I’m really glad I did this. It feels like a big step towards more sustainable science,”_ .
