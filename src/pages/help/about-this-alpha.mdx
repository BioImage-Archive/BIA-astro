## About this Alpha

Welcome to the alpha of the new BioImage-Archive website! 

### What to expect

While this new site is under development, the existing [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/) site will still be actively maintainted.

We are currently working on adding existing and incoming submissions to the alpha. In the meantime, they can all be found on the [current website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/studies).

We are also working on displaying images from every submission, but in the meantime you may see placeholders. Similarly, some studies will not have any files or images listed on their pages.

This website will undergo frequent updates as we get feedback, so pages may move and content may be replaced.

### Feedback

We would love to hear your feedback on the alpha, as this will help guide and prioritise future development of the BioImage Archive. Please send feedback, both positive and negative, by emailing us at: bioimage-archive@ebi.ac.uk

### Alpha FAQ

#### How long will the website be in alpha?
We are yet to announce a date for the end of the alpha.

#### Why is my submission not being displayed?
We are processing publicly released submissions to display on this alpha website, but we do not yet automatically process studies. Submissions that do not follow our standard template require additional conversion, but they will eventually make it to the alpha.

#### Why does my submission not have any images/files/data?
We do not yet automatically process files from submissions, nor turn them into images, in order to be displayed in this alpha. Submission data can be still be found on their study pages, which is linked to via the "Original Study" button on every submission.
