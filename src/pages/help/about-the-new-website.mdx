## About the new BioImage Archive website

Welcome to the beta version of the new BioImage Archive website!

We have developed a new web interface to the BioImage Archive’s data collections. This site provides an opportunity to view images interactively, explore their contextual information and look at curated collections.

### What to expect

While this new site is under development, the existing [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) site will still be actively maintainted. In particular, data submission should be initiated through that site.

We are currently working on adding existing and incoming submissions to the beta. In the meantime, they can all be found on the [current website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/studies).

We are also working on displaying images from most submissions, but sometimes you may see placeholders. 

This website will undergo frequent updates as we get feedback, so pages may move and content may be replaced. Please be careful about relying on links to beta pages!

### Feedback

We would love to hear your feedback on the beta, as this will help guide and prioritise future development of the BioImage Archive. Please fill in out our [very short questionnaire](https://forms.gle/cacdsjj8cgrGgMHu9) (fewer than 10 questions) or feel free to email us at: bioimage-archive@ebi.ac.uk

### Beta FAQ

#### How long will the website be in beta?
We are yet to announce a date for the end of the beta. We intend to improve its functionality based on user feedback until it’s ready to replace the existing website.

#### Why is my submission not being displayed?
We are processing publicly released submissions to display on this beta website, but it can take some time from the moment a submission is released until you can find it on beta. Submissions that do not follow our standard template require additional conversion, but they will eventually make it to the beta.

#### Why does a submission not have any interactive images?
There are some image formats that we currently cannot convert into the appropriate format for in-browser visualisation, and images inside archive files (e.g. zips) are hard to convert. Additionally, older submissions may not have all the necessary metadata to enable this process.  Alternatively, you can browse the submitted images and files using the “Browse all files” button.
