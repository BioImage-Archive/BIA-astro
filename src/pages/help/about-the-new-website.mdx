## About the new BioImage-Archive website

Welcome to the beta of the new BioImage-Archive website! 

We have developed a complete new web interface to the BioImage Archive's data collections. This site provides an early opportunity to view images interactively, explore their contextual information and look at curated collections.

### What to expect

While this new site is under development, the existing [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/) site will still be actively maintainted.

We are currently working on adding existing and incoming submissions to the beta. In the meantime, they can all be found on the [current website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/studies).

We are also working on displaying images from most submissions, but in the meantime you may see placeholders. Similarly, some studies will not have any files or images listed on their pages.

This website will undergo frequent updates as we get feedback, so pages may move and content may be replaced.

### Feedback

We would love to hear your feedback on the beta, as this will help guide and prioritise future development of the BioImage Archive. Please fill in out our [very short questionnaire](https://forms.gle/CJNeXjVKcSKgF1xP7) (fewer than 10 questions) or feel free to email us at: bioimage-archive@ebi.ac.uk

### Beta FAQ

#### How long will the website be in beta?
We are yet to announce a date for the end of the beta.

#### Why is my submission not being displayed?
We are processing publicly released submissions to display on this beta website, but we do not yet automatically process studies. Submissions that do not follow our standard template require additional conversion, but they will eventually make it to the beta.

#### Why does my submission not have any images/files/data?
We do not yet automatically process files from submissions, nor turn them into images, in order to be displayed in this beta. Submission data can be still be found on their study pages, which is linked to via the "Original Study" button on every submission.
