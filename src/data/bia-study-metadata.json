        "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

                        "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                        "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                        "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

        "release_date": "2024-05-17",
        "description": "We present a 3D digital atlas of Cardamine hirsuta ovule development with cellular resolution. The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth (stage 1-I) to the mature pre-fertilization ovule (stage 3-VI). The atlas provides information about the number of cells, their tissue classification, and about characteristics of cellular morphology, such as cell size and shape, for nearly all cells of the ovule. The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

Scan speed was at 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 1 Airy units, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 0.75 and 2. For z-stacks, 12 or 16 bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.33 \u03bcm with voxel size of 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.33 \u03bcm. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

        "release_date": "2024-05-03",
        "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication form between bacteria via small signal molecules that enables global gene regulation as a function of cell density. We applied a microfluidic mother machine to study the kinetics of the QS response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to additions and withdrawals of signal molecules. We traced the fast buildup and the subsequent considerably slower decay of a population-level and single-cell-level QS response. We applied a mathematical model to explain the results quantitatively. We found significant heterogeneity in QS on the single-cell level, which may result from variations in quorum-controlled gene expression and protein degradation. Heterogeneity correlates with cell lineage history, too. We used single-cell data to define and quantitatively characterize the population-level quorum state. We found that the population-level QS response is well-defined. The buildup of the quorum is fast upon signal molecule addition. At the same time, its decay is much slower following signal withdrawal, and the quorum may be maintained for several hours in the absence of the signal.

        "release_date": "2023-04-11",
        "description": "Studies of postmortem human tissue provide insight into pathological processes, but are inherently limited by practical considerations that limit the scale at which tissue can be examined, and the obvious issue that the tissue reflects only one time point in a continuous disease process.  We approached this problem by adapting new tissue clearance techniques to an entire cortical area of human brain, which allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of neurons throughout the depth of the entire cortical thickness.  This approach allows detection of \u201crare\u201d events, that may be difficult to detect in standard 5 micron-thick paraffin sections. For example, it is well established that neurofibrillary tangles begin within a neuron, and ultimately, in at least some instances, persist in the brain even after the neuron has died. These are referred to as \u201cghost tangles\u201d, a term that appropriately implies their \u201cdifficult to see\u201d ephemeral qualities. We set out to find ghost tangles as one example of the power of the tissue clearance/image analysis techniques to detect rare events, and to learn what happens at the end point of a tangle\u2019s life history. We were able to identify 8103 AT8+ tau tangles, 132465 HuD+ neurons, and 299640 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Braak V-VI) and 4 AT8+ tau tangles, 200447 HuD+ neurons, and 462715 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with no significant tau pathology (Braak 0-I).  Among these data we located 57 ghost tangles, which makes them only 0.7% of the total tau tangles observed. We found that ghost tangles are more likely to be found in cortical layers 3 and 5 (49/57), with a select few scattered across other layers 1, 2, 4, and 6. This ability to find rare events, such as ghost tangles, in large enough quantities to statistically test their distribution exemplifies how tissue clearing can be used as a powerful tool for studying selective vulnerability or resilience to pathology across brain regions.",

The staining was then segmented using Ilastik\u2019s pixel classifier workflow. Pixel probability maps and raw data were loaded into Ilastik\u2019s object classification workflow. 1000x1000 pixel regions of each tissue z-stack were cropped and used to train object classifiers. DAPI and Hud object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, single cells, or inseparable clusters of cells. Tau object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, incomplete circle, complete circle, and solid circle shapes. Data was processed as 500x500x20 blocks and applied over the entire image volumes. Data was exported as object identities and spreadsheets with information about the objects\u2019 classification and characteristics, which were then loaded into matlab code to match objects from each channel with colocalized objects."

Tissue was then rinsed 3 times with 50ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes each, then placed in fresh PBS overnight at 4, and rinsed with fresh PBS. Fixed tissue underwent three rinsing cycles in 10-minute increments using 50ml of PBS, then were placed in fresh PBS overnight at 4oC. In preparation for tissue slicing, tissue was transferred to individual 35 mm Petri dishes and embedded in a gel block by pouring warm 4% agarose gel solution in PBS (4g/100ml) (Promega, cat No. V3121) over the tissue. The gel was then cooled to solidify, and cut into a block to provide rigidity for cutting even slices. The tissue was secured on Vibratome (Leica Biosystems, VT1000 S Vibrating Blade Microtome) slide via super gluing the bottom of the agarose block. The vibratome was then used to slice 0.5-1mm thick sections of tissue. Each slice was then removed from the agarose through gentle manipulation with blunt forceps or paintbrushes and were then placed in crosslinking solution, described below.\n\nEach slice was incubated with a hydrogel crosslinking solution containing PBS with 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, ca No. A3553) and 0.25% (wt/vol) VA-044 thermal polymerization initiator (Fisher Scientific, ca No. NC0632395) for 1 day at 4oC to let the molecules diffuse through the tissue. Solutions must be kept cold before and after the addition of VA-044 to prevent premature initiation of polymerization. After incubation with the crosslinking solution for 1 day, the tissue was left in solution and placed in vacuum at 37oC for 3 hours. After polymerization with X-CLARITY polymerization system (Logos Biosystems, South Korea), the slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS three times over 3 hours. \n\nTissue was then placed into Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. L3771) 28.83g/ 500ml PBS clearing solution supplemented with Sodium Borate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. S9640) on shaker at 100 rpm and 37C for approximately 3 days. After delipidation, the brain slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS five times over 24 hours.\n\nEach brain slice was placed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube that could hold the slice so its large, flat sides could be exposed to solution. PBST (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to just cover the top of the samples (~500 \u00b5l). Tissue was heated to 50oC for 1 hour in PBST and then cooled to room temperature prior to incubation with antibodies. The following conjugated antibodies were then added to the solution containing each tissue slice: phospho-tau Ser202, Thr 205 (AT8, 1.6:500, ThermoFisher, cat No. MN1020) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher, cat No. A37573), HuD Antibody E-1 (1.6:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat No. sc-28299) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (ThermoFisher, cat No. A37571), and 4\u2019,6-Diamidine-2\u2019-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1.6:500, Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. 10236276001).

                        "protocol_description": "- Live cell imaging and high speed imaging\nThe live imaging was performed as previously described method. In brief, the organisms were introduced in a rectangular microfluidic chip (length 2.2cm, width 1cm, height 150\u03bcm) of glass slides with copper side walls which act as electrodes. A high speed camera (Phantom V1210 camera, 10000fps) mounted to the microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2, 40X DIC objective) and an electrophysiological DC pulse generator (Grass instruments, S88) were synchronized with a micro-controller (Arduino Uno). Pulse voltage and duration were chosen according to previously reported results.\n\n- Transmission Electron Microscopy\nSpirostomum ambiguum were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PHEM buffer for at least one hour at room temperature. The samples were stained with Safranin-O and stabilized in 1% low melting point agarose, then cut into 1mm cubes. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, room temperature (RT)) in 1X PBS, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 1xPBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, RT) in buffer and then briefly in distilled water. Samples were then subjected to an ascending acetone gradient (10min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%) followed by pure acetone (2\u00d7; 10 min, RT). Samples were progressively infiltrated with Epon resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), while rocking, and then polymerized at 60\u2103 for 24-48 hours in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), collected on glass slides and used for general orientation. Thin sections (70-80 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. Thin sections were\npost-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate, 5 mins each. Then sections were either imaged using a Tecnai 12 120kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) at UC Berkeley, or imaged in the JEOL JEM-1400 120kV with photo taken using a Gatan Orius 2k X 2k digital camera at Stanford University. The montage image was created by SerialEM. All segmentation of organelles was done manually on Fiji.\n\n- Confocal Imaging\nSpirostomum ambiguum were stained alive in 625ng/mL DiOC6(3) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #318426-250MG) and 500nM MitoTracker\u2122 Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #M7510) for 30 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

A high speed camera (Phantom V1210 camera, 10000fps) mounted to the microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2, 40X DIC objective) and an electrophysiological DC pulse generator (Grass instruments, S88) were synchronized with a micro-controller (Arduino Uno). Pulse voltage and duration were chosen according to previously reported results.\n\n- Transmission Electron Microscopy\nSpirostomum ambiguum were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PHEM buffer for at least one hour at room temperature. The samples were stained with Safranin-O and stabilized in 1% low melting point agarose, then cut into 1mm cubes. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, room temperature (RT)) in 1X PBS, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 1xPBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, RT) in buffer and then briefly in distilled water. Samples were then subjected to an ascending acetone gradient (10min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%) followed by pure acetone (2\u00d7; 10 min, RT). Samples were progressively infiltrated with Epon resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), while rocking, and then polymerized at 60\u2103 for 24-48 hours in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), collected on glass slides and used for general orientation. Thin sections (70-80 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. Thin sections were\npost-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate, 5 mins each. Then sections were either imaged using a Tecnai 12 120kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) at UC Berkeley, or imaged in the JEOL JEM-1400 120kV with photo taken using a Gatan Orius 2k X 2k digital camera at Stanford University. The montage image was created by SerialEM. All segmentation of organelles was done manually on Fiji.\n\n- Confocal Imaging\nSpirostomum ambiguum were stained alive in 625ng/mL DiOC6(3) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #318426-250MG) and 500nM MitoTracker\u2122 Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #M7510) for 30 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

        "description": "Molecular subtyping of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) has been performed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level. However, LUSC stratification based on tissue metabolomics is still lacking. Combining high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry with consensus clustering, four tumor- and four stroma-specific subtypes with distinct metabolite patterns were identified in 330 LUSC patients. The first tumor subtype T1 negatively correlated with DNA damage and immunological features including CD3, CD8, and PD-L1. The same features positively correlated with the tumor subtype T2. Tumor subtype T4 was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Compared with the status of subtypes T1 and T4, patients with subtype T3 had improved prognosis, and T3 was an independent prognostic factor with regard to UICC stage. Similarly, stroma subtypes were linked to distinct immunological features and metabolic pathways. Stroma subtype S4 had a better prognosis than S2. Subsequently, analyses based on an independent LUSC cohort treated by neoadjuvant therapy revealed that the S2 stroma subtype was associated with chemotherapy resistance. Clinically relevant patient subtypes as determined by tissue-based spatial metabolomics are a valuable addition to existing molecular classification systems. Metabolic differences among the subtypes and their associations with immunological features may contribute to the improvement of personalized therapy.",

To image the whole HPF carrier volume and locate single organoids, we first detected cell nuclei marked with Hoechst-33342 and acquired z-stacks with 6x6 tiles of 5122 pixels with 10% overlap, and 10 \u03bcm z-step. The final montage was stitched using ZEN-black software. For single organoids, we acquired z-stacks of 10242 pixels at different z-steps ranging from 1.0 or 1.8 \u03bcm. ",

        "description": "Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta's heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the \u2018Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY\u2019 (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY\u2019s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature.",

        "description": "Recently, a low-level somatic mutation in the NRAS gene (c.182 A > G, Q61R) was identified in various specimens from patients with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis. However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

NRASWT HDLECs showed well-regulated lumen structures and tube formation, but NRASQ61R HDLECs exhibited sheet-like proliferation and the formation of capillary-like structures was markedly less than that of NRASWT HDLECs. The higher the proportion of NRASQ61R HDLECs (fluorescent cells), the greater the sheet-like proliferation and the fewer the capillary-like structures.  2B: In the stepwise examination of NRASQ61R HDLEC mixtures, the covered area (occupied area by cellular components) (a), total nets (number of nets) (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) were analyzed by WinTube.

                            "Metabolome analysis was conducted in accordance with HMT\u2019s C-SCOPE package, using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) for cation analysis and CE-tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) for anion analysis on the basis of the methods described previously (Ohashi et al., 2008; Ooga et al., 2)11,12. Briefly, CE-TOFMS and CE-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent CE capillary electrophoresis system equipped with an Agilent 6210 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Agilent 6460 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (Agilent Technologies), respectively. The systems were controlled by Agilent G2201AA ChemStation software version B.03.01 for CE (Agilent Technologies) and connected by a fused silica capillary (50 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 80 cm total length) with commercial electrophoresis buffer (H3301-1001 and I3302-1023 for cation and anion analyses, respectively, at HMT) as the electrolyte. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 50 to 1,000 (Ohashi et al., 2008)11 and the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to detect compounds in dynamic MRM mode. Peaks were extracted using MasterHands, automatic integration software (Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan) (Sugimoto et al., 2009)13 and MassHunter Quantitative Analysis B.04.00 (Agilent Technologies) to obtain peak information including m/z, peak area and migration time (MT). Signal peaks were annotated in accordance with HMT\u2019s metabolite database based on their m/z values and MTs. The peak area of each metabolite was normalized to internal standards, and metabolite concentration was evaluated by standard curves with three-point calibrations using each standard compound. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis (Yamamoto et al., 2014)14 were performed by HMT\u2019s proprietary MATLAB and R programs, respectively. Detected metabolites were plotted on metabolic pathway maps using VANTED software (Junker et al., 2006)15."

The Lenti-X 293 T cell line was spread on 10-cm plates at a density 5.0 \u00d7 106 cells per plate and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 24 h. The pLVSIN-EF1\u03b1-AcGFP-C1 vector (5.5 \u03bcg) was added to 7 \u03bcL Lentiviral Mix High Titer Packaging Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), 1500 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM, and 45 \u03bcL Trans IT-293 Transfection Reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). After 15 min, this mixture was added to Lenti-X 293 T cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM. After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (this solution contained recombinant lentiviruses). HDLECs were spread onto six-well plates at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The recombinant lentiviral solution was diluted with EBM2 to give solutions with initial concentrations of 1:4 to 1:10. The medium was discarded from each well, and 2 ml of the recombinant lentiviral solutions were added to each well. Polybrene was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. To select stably GFP-only or C-terminal GFP-fused NRASQ61R cells, repeated exchange of the medium and the addition of puromycin (final concentrations of 1.5 \u03bcg/m and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) were performed every 72 h. NRASQ61R expression in these cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GFP gene was transfected into HDLECs by the same method. These transfected cells and NRAS wild type fluorescent cells were used in the scratch assay.",

The Lenti-X 293 T cell line was spread on 10-cm plates at a density 5.0 \u00d7 106 cells per plate and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 24 h. The pLVSIN-EF1\u03b1-AcGFP-C1 vector (5.5 \u03bcg) was added to 7 \u03bcL Lentiviral Mix High Titer Packaging Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), 1500 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM, and 45 \u03bcL Trans IT-293 Transfection Reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). After 15 min, this mixture was added to Lenti-X 293 T cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM. After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (this solution contained recombinant lentiviruses). HDLECs were spread onto six-well plates at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The recombinant lentiviral solution was diluted with EBM2 to give solutions with initial concentrations of 1:4 to 1:10. The medium was discarded from each well, and 2 ml of the recombinant lentiviral solutions were added to each well. Polybrene was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. To select stably GFP-only or C-terminal GFP-fused NRASQ61R cells, repeated exchange of the medium and the addition of puromycin (final concentrations of 1.5 \u03bcg/m and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) were performed every 72 h. NRASQ61R expression in these cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GFP gene was transfected into HDLECs by the same method.

        "description": "In Drosophila male gonads, niche-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has a role in maintaining stem cells in close proximity but the range of Dpp diffusion and its role has never been tested in the differentiating cells spaced one-cell layer away. Here, using genetically encoded nanobodies called Morphotraps, we physically block Dpp diffusion without interfering with niche-stem cell signaling and find that a diffusible fraction of Dpp is required to ensure differentiation of GSC daughter cells, opposite of its role in maintenance of GSC in the niche. Our work provides an example in which a soluble niche ligand induces opposed cellular responses in stem cells versus differentiating descendants to ensure spatial control of the niche, which may be a common mechanism to regulate tissue homeostasis.",

        "description": "The tight control of fate transitions during stem cell differentiation is essential for proper\ntissue development and maintenance. However, identifying how the multilayered regulation\nof gene expression programmes orchestrates stem cell differentiation in vivo remains\nelusive, because of the challenges in studying sparsely distributed adult stem cells in a\nsystematic manner. Here, we synchronised Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC)\ndifferentiation in vivo to perform in-depth transcriptome and translatome analyses at high\ndevelopmental resolution. This characterisation revealed widespread and dynamic changes\nin mRNA level, promoter usage, exon inclusion, and translation efficiency. Transient\nexpression of the master regulator, Bam, drives a first wave of expression changes, primarily\nmodifying the cell cycle programme. Surprisingly, as Bam levels recede, differentiating cells\nreturn to a remarkably stem cell-like transcription and translation programme, with a few\ncrucial changes feeding into a second phase driving terminal differentiation to form the\noocyte. Altogether, these findings reveal that rather than a unidirectional accumulation of\nchanges, the in vivo differentiation programme relies on distinctly regulated and\ndevelopmentally sequential waves.",

        "description": "The functional importance of nuclear protein condensation remains often unclear. The bHLH FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) controls iron acquisition and growth in plants. Previously described C-terminal serine residues allow FIT to interact and form active transcription factor complexes with subgroup Ib bHLH factors such as bHLH039. FIT has lower nuclear mobility than mutant FITmSS271AA. Here, we show that FIT undergoes a light-inducible subnuclear partitioning into FIT nuclear bodies (NBs). Using quantitative and qualitative microscopy-based approaches, we characterized FIT NBs as condensates that were reversible and likely formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. FIT accumulated preferentially in NBs versus nucleoplasm when engaged in protein complexes with itself and with bHLH039. FITmSS271AA, instead, localized to NBs with different dynamics. FIT colocalized with splicing and light signaling NB markers. The NB-inducing light conditions were linked with active FIT and elevated FIT target gene expression in roots. FIT condensation may affect nuclear mobility and be relevant for integrating environmental and Fe nutrition signals.",

Z-stacks were exported from the ZEN lite (Zeiss) software as TIFF (no compression, all dimensions) first. In ImageJ, Z-stacks were converted to RGB and 8-bit. Correct scale was set (in \u00b5m) under \u2018Properties\u2019. Parameters that should be quantified were selected under \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u2018Set 3D Measurements\u2019. To perform the analysis, \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u20183D object counter\u2019 was selected. Threshold for the intensity limit (areas below that limit were not considered for quantification) was set manually for every z-stack. Calculated values were further processed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Only size between 0,01-15 \u00b5m\u00b3 was considered. The reason for preferring manual versus automatic image adjustments is as follows: FIT NBs were numerous with varying size and signal intensity. We had found that a fixed threshold for intensity within the ImageJ software caused a loss of NBs when present but below the set threshold. To avoid this, manual inspection was preferred when using the ImageJ software to segment correctly."

An OD600nm of 0.4 was set for all constructs. A Rhizobium radiobacter strain containing the silencing repressor p19 vector (Shamloul et al., 2014) was used additionally for bHLH039-mCherry to enhance expression. After 1 h incubation on ice the suspension was infiltrated with a syringe into the abaxial side of the leaf. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were kept under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) in the laboratory after infiltration. Imaging was performed 2-3 d after infiltration. Expression of constructs with an inducible 35S promoter was induced 16 h prior to imaging with \u03b2-estradiol (20 \u00b5M \u03b2-estradiol (in DMSO), 0.1 % (v/v) Tween 20). In total, 3-4 differently aged leaves of 2 plants were infiltrated and used for imaging. One infiltrated leaf with homogenous presence of one or two fluorescence proteins was selected, depending on the aim of the experiment.\nStandardized FIT NB analysis procedure:\nFollowing Nicotiana benthamiana leaf infiltration with Rhizobium radiobacter, protein expression was induced after 2-3 d by \u03b2-estradiol, as described above. 16 h later, a leaf disc was excised and fluorescence signals were recorded (t=0). The leaf disc was excited with 488 nm laser light for 1 min. 5 min later, accumulation in NBs was observed (t= 5 min).

        "release_date": "2024-01-22",
        "description": "Diabetes is caused by the inability of electrically coupled, functionally heterogeneous \u03b2-cells within the pancreatic islet to provide adequate insulin secretion. Functional networks have been used to represent synchronized oscillatory [Ca2+] dynamics and to study \u03b2-cell subpopulations, which play an important role in driving islet function. The mechanism by which highly synchronized \u03b2-cell subpopulations drive islet function is unclear. We used experimental and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between functional networks, structural (gap-junction) networks, and intrinsic \u03b2-cell dynamics in slow and fast oscillating islets. Highly synchronized subpopulations in the functional network were differentiated by intrinsic dynamics, including metabolic activity and KATP channel conductance, more than structural coupling. Consistent with this, intrinsic dynamics were more predictive of high synchronization in the islet functional network as compared to high levels of structural coupling. Finally, dysfunction of gap junctions, which can occur in diabetes, caused decreases in the efficiency and clustering of the functional network. These results indicate that intrinsic dynamics rather than structure drive connections in the functional network and highly synchronized subpopulations, but gap junctions are still essential for overall network efficiency. These findings deepen our interpretation of functional networks and the formation of functional sub-populations in dynamic tissues such as the islet.\u2003",

        "description": "During asymmetric cell division, cell polarity is coordinated with the cell cycle to allow proper inheritance of cell fate determinants and generation of cellular diversity. In the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) zygote, polarity is governed by evolutionarily conserved Partitioning (PAR) proteins that segregate to opposing cortical domains to specify asymmetric cell fates. Timely establishment of PAR domains requires a cell cycle kinase, Aurora A (AIR-1 in C. elegans). Aurora A depletion by RNAi causes a spectrum of phenotypes including reversed polarity,  excess posterior domains, and no posterior domain. How depletion of a single kinase can cause seemingly opposite phenotypes remains obscure. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system and drug treatments, we found that AIR-1 regulates polarity differently at different times of the cell cycle. During meiosis I, AIR-1 acts to prevent later formation of bipolar domains, while in meiosis II, AIR-1 is necessary to recruit PAR-2 onto the membrane. Together these data clarify the origin of multiple polarization phenotypes in RNAi experiments and reveal multiple roles of AIR-1 in coordinating PAR protein localization with cell cycle progression.

        "release_date": "2024-03-30",
        "description": "Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient needed in many metabolic processes. To balance needs and potential toxicity, plants control the amount of Fe they take up and allocate to leaves and seeds during their development. One important regulator of this process is POPEYE (PYE). PYE is a Fe deficiency-induced key bHLH transcription factor (TF) for allocation of internal Fe in plants. In the absence of PYE, there is altered Fe translocation and plants develop a leaf chlorosis. NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE4 (NAS4), FERRIC-REDUCTION OXIDASE3 (FRO3), and ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR1 (ZIF1) genes are expressed at higher level in pye-1 indicating that PYE represses these genes. PYE activity is controlled in a yet unknown manner. Here, we show that a small Fe deficiency-induced protein OLIVIA (OLV) can interact with PYE. OLV has a conserved C-terminal motif, that we named TGIYY. Through deletion mapping, we pinpointed that OLV TGIYY and several regions of PYE can be involved in the protein interaction. An OLV overexpressing (OX) mutant line exhibited an enhanced NAS4 gene expression. This was a mild Fe deficiency response phenotype that was related to PYE function. Leaf rosettes of olv mutants remained smaller than those of wild type, indicating that OLV promotes plant growth. Taken together, our study identified a small protein OLV as a candidate that may connect aspects of Fe homeostasis with regulation of leaf growth.",

The suspension was adjusted to OD600=0.4 and infiltrated with a 1 ml syringe into the abaxial side of two tobacco leaves on two different plants. For co-localization experiments using GFP- and mCherry-tagged proteins, both Agrobacteria suspensions were mixed 1:1 to obtain a final OD600=0.4 for each. Transformed tobacco plants were kept in the lab for 48 to 72 h at RT under long day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark). To induce the expression of constructs, infiltrated tobacco leaves were sprayed abaxially with 20 \u00b5M \u00df-estradiol (in DMSO, supplemented with 0.1 % (v/v) Tween20) 16 h before imaging. To analyze transgene expression and protein localization, 0.5 cm leaf discs were punched out and imaged using alaser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM780, Zeiss). ",

        "description": "Redox homeostasis modulates the morphology of cardiomyocytes\nRedox homeostasis is affected in heart failure. Remodelling of heart failure has been associated with enhanced ROS production due to alterations in the excitation-contraction coupling, or due to altered cytoplasmic calcium handling (M\u00fcnzel, Gori et al. 2015). However, these alterations are met by adaptations of the antioxidative system to restore redox homeostasis. We have noted that redox induces changes to cardiomyocytes geometry, where oxidative stress induces cardiomyocytes\u2019 elongation and atrophy, while antioxidative compounds promotes cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. These alterations in the cardiomyocyte\u2019s geometry resemble the changes observed to geometry of the heart during heart failure and indicate that intracellular redox homeostasis is involved in regulating the morphology of cardiomyocytes. We quantitatively measured these alterations in cell morphology upon treating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with a pro-oxidant (Sulforaphane, SF) and an antioxidant (N-Acetyl Cysteine, NAC). We utilized florescence microscopic imaging, followed by image analysis with ImageJ. This experiment is part of a study that investigates the impact of endogenous antioxidative defenses in the heart and the potentially adverse effects associated with excessive quenching of physiological levels of reactive oxygen species, which act as cellular signalling molecules. The study is now available as a pre-pint on BioRxiv (Epigenetic modulators link mitochondrial redox homeostasis to cardiac function a sex-dependent manner, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.26.485908), and under consideration for publication in Nature Communications.",

In short, we developed an unbiased approach to profile the shape of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in Fiji 60. The \u03b1-actinin channel was utilized for segmentation. The workflow consisted of a pre-processing step in which the median filter was applied to the input images in order to reduce noise. Then, the images were segmented using the Li\u2019s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method. To avoid any bias in quantifying segmented cardiomyocytes between different treatments, we excluded all cropped cells that were on the images\u2019 edges. We also excluded segmented particles with an area smaller than 50000 pixels.\nTo quantify the changes in cell shape upon treatments, we utilized the minimum caliper diameter (MinFeret shape descriptor in Fiji), which measures the smallest diameter between any two points at the boundary of a segmented object. We also utilized the area of the segmented objects to visualize changes in cardiomyocytes\u2019 size upon different treatments. However, NRCMs in 2D culture acquire a variety of random shapes and sizes, and the diversity in the shapes and sizes were further greatly enhanced by the SF and NAC treatments, which also affected the identifications of contiguous cells\u2019 boundaries. This fact made it impossible to segment all individual cardiomyocytes, especially in the NAC treatment, where cells were hypertrophied and more intertwined. This problem was not even possible to resolve by manual curation of cells\u2019 borders or by staining the cytoplasmic membrane. As our interest was to quantify the changes in cell area and diameter between different treatments, we segmented connected cells as one object. We segmented 6 images from the control group, and 8 images from each of SF and NAC treatments. The segmentation resulted in 123-196 objects per image. For each object of each image, we computed the area and minimum diameter. To plot them, we pooled the measures of each condition together. Pooling them resulted in groups of values, in which each value originated from one image (6 for the control condition,8 for NAC and 8 for SF treatments). Then we calculated the average of each group. This resulted in 148 objects in the control condition, 144 objects in the NAC treatment, and 196 objects in the SF treatment as shown in the Source Data File. These averaged values of the segmented objects\u2019 area and MinFeret were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The implemented image analysis pipeline is available in Github (https://github.com/BIIFSweden/CellGeometryProfiling)."

After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS to remove dead cells and incubated for another 48 h with maintenance medium (similar composition of the CM plating medium but supplemented with 2.5 \u00b5M of the mitotic inhibitor cytarabine, (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)). Cells were then treated with sulforaphane  (SF, 5\u00b5M) or N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 3 mM)  (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) for 72 h. The maintenance medium was changed every 24 h with fresh supplements of SF or NAC.\n\nTreated NRCMs  in 6-well plate with a plastic bottom were fixed with 4% buffered formalin. Cells were washed with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT and blocked with a blocking buffer (1% BSA, 22.52 mg/ml glycine and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 30 min at RT. The primary antibody (mouse anti-\u03b1-actinin antibodies A7811, Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted with an incubation buffer (1%BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS,1:1000) and incubated overnight at 4oC. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated antibody ab175473, Abcam) were diluted with incubation buffer (1:1000) and incubated for 1h at RT. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS after each step. Widefield images were acquired as described in the following section.",

For initial polyclonal and monoclonal cell lines selection, after aspirating culture media, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. Cells were then mounted onto glass slides with EverBrite mounting medium with DAPI (Biotium Cat #23002), and ready for imaging. For the final monoclonal cell line characterization, the localization of all spatial APEX2 constructs were determined by the co-localization analysis with subcellular location markers. Cells were first washed with PBS twice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT). After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT and blocked in 5% BSA (w/v) in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 1h at RT. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS-T against GFP (1:500) and Vimentin (1:100) for NES, GFP (1:500) and E-cadherin (1:500) for Lyn11, Rab 5 (1:200) for 2xFYVE , Rab9 (1:200) for LAMTOR1 and LAMP1, Golgin-97 (1:200) for GalT, and Alexa 647-conjugated M1-anti-FLAG antibody (1:200) for 5HT2A was performed at 4 oC overnight. After washing with PBS-T three times, cells were incubated with AF488-labeled goat anti-Chicken, AF555-labeled goat anti-Mouse, and AF647-labeled goat anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS-T (1:1000) for 1 hour at RT. Cells were then washed in PBS-T twice and one final wash in PBS, mounted onto glass slides using EverBrite mounting medium with DAPI (Biotium Cat #23002), and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Images were generated using a Nikon Ti2-E microscope equipped with a Crest X-Light-V2 spinning disk confocal (Crest Optics), emission filters, 438/24 (DAPI), 511/20 (GFP), 560/25 (RFP), and 685/40 (Cy5), and Celeste Light Engine excitation lasers 405/477/546/638 nm used respectively (Lumencor), Piezo stage (Mad City Labs), and a Prime 95B 25mm CMOS camera (Photometrics) using a Plan Apo VC 100x/1.4 Oil (Nikon). The data was captured with NIS-Elements software (v. 5.41.01 build 1709, Nikon) and processed in Fiji/ImageJ2 (Schindelin et al, 2012). \n",

TMA sections (4 \u03bcm) were affixed to Vectabond-precoated 25 x 25 mm coverslips, coated with paraffin, and stored for future staining.\n\nAntibody conjugation, validation, and titration:\n\nWe used the co-detection by indexing (CODEX) approach for multicolor immunofluorescence21. Antibodies utilized for CODEX experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. We reduced purified, carrier-free antibodies with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and conjugated them with maleimide-modified CODEX DNA oligonucleotides, procured from TriLink Biotechnologies. A board-certified pathologist supervised the evaluation of the conjugated antibodies in singleplex stains on tonsil and/or lymphoma tissue, comparing with online databases, immunohistochemical reference stains, and published literature. We validated staining patterns in multiplex experiments with positive and negative control antibodies and titrated the appropriate dilution of each antibody starting from 1:100 to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nMultiplex tissue staining and fixation:\n\nWe deparaffinized, and rehydrated coverslips, and subjected them to heat-induced epitope retrieval at pH9 and 97\u00b0C for 10 minutes in a Lab Vision PT module. After blocking non-specific binding with CODEX FFPE blocking solution, we stained the coverslips overnight with the full antibody panel. Following staining, coverslips were fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde, methanol, and BS3 fixative, then stored in CODEX buffer S4 until imaging.\n",

These images were collected from iXist-ChrX mouse embryonic stem cell lines engineered with the FKBP12 degron tag fused to endogenous YY1, such that addition of dTAG-13 acutely degrades YY1 protein from cells. Degradation of YY1 - either prior to Xist induction or after prolonged Xist induction - has little effect on the appearance of Xist RNA territories over the Xi chromosome. ",

Xist expression was induced either 2 or 6 days prior to fixation, with dTAG-13 added to degrade YY1 52 h prior to fixation. . At collection, cells on coverslips were washed once with PBS, fixed in the 6-well plate with 3% formaldehyde (pH7) for 10 min, then washed once with PBS, twice with PBST.5 (0.05% Tween20 in PBS), and transferred into a new 6-well dish for permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT. After three further PBST.5 washes, cells on cover slips were subjected to ethanol dehydration by an initial incubation with 70% EtOH (for 30 min at RT), then progressive exchanges to 80%, 90% and finally 100% EtOH. Xist FISH probe was prepared from an 18 kb cloned cDNA (pBS_Xist) spanning the whole Xist transcript using a Nick translation kit (Enzo Biosciences). The FISH hybridisation mix consisted of: 3 \u03bcL Texas Red-labelled Xist probe (~50 ng DNA), 1 \u03bcL 10 mg/mL Salmon Sperm DNA, 0.4 \u03bcL 3M NaOAc and 3 volumes of 100% EtOH per sample. This was precipitated by centrifugation (20,000 g for 20 min at 4oC), washed with 70% EtOH, air-dried, then resuspended in 6 \u03bcL deionised formamide (Merck Life Science) per hybridisation and incubated in a shaker (1400 rpm) at 42oC for at least 30 min. 2X hybridisation buffer (4X SSC, 20% dextran sulphate, 2 mg/mL BSA (NEB), 1/10 volume nuclease free water and 1/10 volume vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex (VRC; pre-warmed at 65oC for 5 min before use)) was denatured at 75oC for 5 min, placed back on ice to cool, then mixed with hybridization mix. Each coverslip was hybridised with 30 \u03bcL probe/hybridisation mix in a humid box at 37oC overnight. The next day, coverslips were washed 3 times for 5 min at 42oC with pre-warmed 50% formamide/2X saline-sodium citrate buffer (1/10 20X SSC in PBST.5), then subjected to further washes (3 x 2XSSC, 1 x PBST.5, 1 x PBS, each for 5 min using a 42oC hot plate) before being mounted with VECTASHIELD plus DAPI (Vector Labs) onto Superfrost Plus microscopy slides (VWR).

Gribnau).\nmESCs were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS; ThermoFisher), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin/ 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all from Life Technologies) and 1000 U/mL LIF (made in-house). Cells were grown on gelatin-coated plates under standard cell culture conditions (37oC, 5% CO2, humid) on a \u2018feeder\u2019 layer of SNLP mouse fibroblasts mitotically inactivated by Mitomycin-C (Sigma Aldrich). mESCs were routinely passaged at ~80% confluency every 2-3 days using TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher). Before experiments, feeder cells were removed by pre-plating to gelatinised cell culture dishes for 30-40 min, with slower-attaching mESCs taken from suspension and plated to new gelatinised dishes.\nXist expression from the TetOn promoter was induced by addition of 1\u00b5g/ml doxycycline (Sigma, D9891). dTAG-13 (Tocris, #6605) was applied to FKBP12F36V-fusion cell lines at 100 nM to induce protein degradation."

        "description": "Although mitochondrial morphology changes have been consistently associated with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ageing, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms at play have remained somewhat obscure. Using a live-cell super-resolution (SR) microscopy technique, we have been able to identify different HSCs subsets that feature mitochondria of distinct morphologies and spatial distributions. Integrating SR microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled us to classify approximately two hundred HSCs from both young and aged mice into five discrete clusters. These clusters show molecular profiles that mirror the varying states of mitochondria. Our integrated approach of RNA biomarker analysis and potential regulon assessment has unveiled hitherto unrecognized functions of GDF15 in mediating mitochondrial signals and morphologies that direct HSCs fate. Therefore, the combination of SR imaging with bioinformatics pipeline offers a notably effective method for the identification of critical molecular players in specific phases of cellular transition, utilizing a relatively small dataset.

The distinctive feature of SD-SIM was the Live-SR module (GATACA system) which was set up on a commercial inverted fluorescence microscope (IX83, Olympus) equipped with a scanning disk confocal system (Yokogawa, CSU-X1). All experiments used 100\u00d7, 1.30 numerical aperture (NA) oil objective lens and two laser beams 405 nm and 488 nm. Images were acquired with EMCCD (Andor, iXon3 897) and sCMOS (Hamamatsu, c14440-20up). All images were possessed with ImageJ software and sparse deconvolved with a commercial software (MicroscopeX FINER, CSR Biotech).",

        "description": "Fast, accurate and affordable bacterial identification methods are paramount for timely treatment of infections, especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). However, today only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach by the acquisition and the subsequent analysis comprising 257 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and inter- species variability, a scenario more akin to the real-world clinical practice rather than the one achievable solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite the variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7 %. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.",

We designed and manufactured the electronic system to operate this sensor. The Petri dish is set directly on the sensor and illuminated from above by the illumination module. That module consists of two monochromatic light sources coupled into a multimode optical fibre via a Y fiber SMA (Thorlabs BFY105LS02): a green LED (550 nm) Thorlabs MINTF4 and a near-infrared LED (940 nm) Thorlabs M940F3.",

We highlight that we willingly chose dilution factors that led to high colony densities, in order to reproduce true field usage of the system. Indeed, when dealing with unknown species, dilution is necessarily species-agnostic and is set such that all tested samples yield a sufficient number of colonies, and consequently many samples show very high colony densities. \n\nAs far as the other samples are concerned (urine/genital tract, wound/skin and respiratory specimens), clinical isolates were first grown on an isolation plate, either on a Mac Conkey agar or on a blood-supplemented medium such as Columbia agar.

Images were captured using the ZEN Imaging Software and processed in Fiji (ImageJ v1.53). \n\nsmRNA-FISH: images were acquired using a LSM880 confocal microscope with an Airyscan system. The Airyscan system has 32-channel GaAsP (Gallium Arsenide Phosphide) detectors, which allow to obtain images with enhanced spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than in traditional LSM systems (Huff 2015). A 63x/1,4 OIL DICII PL APO objective was used. Images were processed in Fiji (ImageJ v1.53).\n\nLive imaging: time-lapse images were acquired using an LSM780 or LSM880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 10x/0,3 DICI EC PL NEOFLUAR, for imaging at the tissue scale. Explants were cultured in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 during imaging.

Mikkola (Voutilainen, Lindfors, and Mikkola 2013).\n\nMammary cultures wholemount immunostaining \nWhole-mount immunostaining of embryonic tissue explants was performed as previously described (Caraba\u00f1a and Lloyd-Lewis 2022). Explants were transferred to 24-well plates, washed in PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 2 hr at RT. After a blocking step in PBS containing 5% FBS, 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 1% Triton x-100 (Euromedex, 2000-C) for 2 hr, explants were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, with secondary Alexa-fluor conjugated antibodies and DAPI (10uM) diluted in PBS for 5 hr at RT. Ex vivo cultures were mounted in a slide using Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences, 18606). \nThe following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-SMA (1:300, Abcam, ab5694), rat anti-K8 (1:300, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone TROMA-I), mouse anti-P63 (1:300, Abcam, ab735), rabbit anti-K5 (1:300, Covance, PRB-160P-100), rat anti-ZO-1 (1:100, Millipore, MABT11), rabbit anti-K14 (1:300, ab181595).\nEdU incorporation was visualized using Click-It chemistry (Invitrogen) by incubating ex vivo cultures for 2 hr with EdU solution (10 \u03bcM). EdU was then detected with freshly made Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10640), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342 (10 \u03bcg/mL) for 30 minutes at RT. \n\nImmunostaining on 2D sections \nEmbryos were harvested and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by another overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in 30% sucrose. Then, embryos were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound and 7 \u03bcm-thick cryosections were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM1950). After a blocking step in PBS containing 5% FBS, 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton x-100 for 2 hr, sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber, then with secondary Alexa-fluor conjugated antibodies and DAPI (10uM) diluted in PBS for 2 hr at RT. Finally, sections were mounted in a slide using Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences, 18606). \nThe following primary antibodies were used: rat anti-K8 (1:300, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone TROMA-I), mouse anti-P63 (1:300, Abcam, ab735), mouse anti-ERalpha (1:20, Agilent-Dako, M7047), rabbit anti-K5 (1:300, Covance, PRB-160P-100), rabbit anti-PLAG1 (1:100) (Spengler et al. 1997) and rabbit anti-LEF1 (1:100, Cell Signaling).\n\nOptical tissue clearing and wholemount immunostaining \nMammary gland at E17.5 and at birth were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Optical tissue clearing was performed as previously described (Lloyd-Lewis et al. 2016). Briefly, tissues were immersed in CUBIC Reagent 1A (urea (10% w/w), Quadrol (5% w/w), triton X-100 (10% w/w) in distilled water) for 2 days at 37\u00b0C, washed in PBS and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing BSA (10%) and triton X-100 (0.5%). Tissues were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C for 3 days with gentle agitation. Then, the samples were washed in PBS 3 times for 1 hr each and incubated with secondary Alexa-fluor conjugated antibodies and DAPI (10uM) diluted in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 2 days with gentle agitation. Tissues were imaged in CUBIC Reagent 2 (sucrose (50% w/v), thiethanolamine (10% w/v), triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) in distilled water). The following primary antibodies were used: rat anti-K8 (1:300, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone TROMA-I), rabbit anti-PH3 (1:300, Millipore). \n\nSingle molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH)\nsmRNA-FISH was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. In brief, tissue cryosections were pre-treated with the target retrieval reagent (ACD, 322000) for 5 minutes and digested with Protease III (ACD, 322381) at 40\u00b0C for 15 minutes, before hybridization with the target oligonucleotide probes. Probe hybridization, amplification and binding of dye-labelled probes were performed sequentially. For subsequent immunostaining, sections were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% FBS and 2% BSA) for 1 hr. For smRNA-FISH in ex vivo explant cultures, the blocking buffer also included 0,3% Triton x-100 (Euromedex, 2000-C) to allow tissue permeabilization. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer was performed overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber, then secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted in PBS were added for 2 hr at RT. The experiments were performed on at least three different embryos for each probe. Slides were mounted in ProLong Diamond Anti-fade Mountant (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930) for imaging. The following RNAscope probes were used: Mm-Anxa1-C2 (ACD, 509291), Mm-Lgals3-C2 (ACD, 461471), Mm-Plet1-C1 (ACD, 557941), Mm-Ly6d-C1 (ACD, 532071), Mm-Cxcl14-C3 (ACD, 459741), Mm-Ndnf-C2 (ACD, 447471), Mm-Pthlh-C3 (ACD, 456521), Mm-Cd74-C1 (ACD, 437501), Mm-Vcan (ACD, 486231), Mm-Cdkn1c-C2 (ACD, 458331), Mm-Crabp1-C3 (ACD, 474711), 3-plex Positive Control Probe-Mm (ACD, PN 320881) and 3-plex Negative Control Probe (ACD, PN 320891). \n",

Embryonic culture medium is DMEM/F-12 (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21331020) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050-038), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (v/v), 20 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122) and 75 \u03bcg/mL Ascorbic acid (Sigma, A4544). Mammary cultures were maintained in a tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The culture media was replaced every two days. For growth factor assays, 1 nM FGF10 (Bio-techne, 6224-FG) was added to the medium at day 4. For experiments using the FGFR inhibitor, mammary buds were collected from E13.5 female embryos and maintained in culture for 4 days, after which 50 nM BGJ398 (Selleckchem, S2183) or DMSO in control wells were added and renewed every two days until day 9 in culture.

Pollinated pistils were cut open using an ophthalmic knife at the valve margins. The remaining locule was immediately placed horizontally on the cut side, and the flower stalk was embedded in the solid PGM. Liquid exuding from the solid PGM filled the bottom of the locule by capillary action. A piece of 0.2 mm thick silicone film was then placed on top of the remaining locule as a weight to prevent lifting.

        "description": "The heterodimeric kinesin-2 motor (KIF3A/KIF3B with accessory protein KAP3) drives intraflagellar transport, essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary function. Three point mutations in the KIF3B subunit have recently been linked to disease in humans (E250Q and L523P) and Bengal cats (A334T) (Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2020). Patients display retinal atrophy and, in some cases, other ciliopathy phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism leading to disease is currently unknown. Here, we used Kif3a-/-;Kif3b-/- (knockout) 3T3 cells, which cannot make cilia, to characterize these mutations. While reexpression of KIF3B(E250Q) and KIF3B(L523P) did not rescue ciliogenesis, reexpression of wildtype or KIF3B(A334T), restored ciliogenesis to wildtype levels. Fluorescent tagging revealed that the E250Q mutant decorated microtubules and thus is a rigor mutation. The L523P mutation, in the alpha-helical stalk domain, surprisingly did not affect formation of the KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3 complex but instead impaired motility along microtubules. Lastly, expression of the A334T motor was reduced in comparison to all other conditions and displayed an impaired ability to disperse the Golgi complex when artificially linked to this high-load cargo. In summary, this work uses cell-based assays to elucidates the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations in the KIF3B subunit on the kinesin-2 holoenzyme.",

Polystyrene of two different molecular weights (Agilent, Mw = 15 x 10^6 g/mol and Polystyrene Standard, Mw = 2.5 x 10^6 g/mol) was dissolved in xylene (Carolina Chemicals) to form polymeric solutions at 5% (w/w). Additionally, 20 uL of 1 mg/mL of BDP FL Maleimide dye (Lumiprobe) was added to the polymer solutions to get fluorescent fibers. Fibers were spun on hollow 5 x 5 mm metal scaffolds. The first layer of fibers deposited were large diameter fibers ~2 um (Mw = 15 x 10^6 g/mol) followed by an orthogonal layer of 200 nm (Mw = 2.5 x 10^6 g/mol) fibers with spacing varying from 7 to 20 um to achieve a variety of cell shapes (elongated on single fibers and parallel-shaped cells on two or more fibers) [Jana 2023, Jana 2022, Singh 2021]. Additionally, crosshatch networks of 200 nm fiber diameters were also prepared with spacing varying from 7 to 20 um [Padhi 2020, Jana2019] to achieve polygonal and kite-shaped cells on multiple fibers. The fiber networks were fused at junctions using a custom-built chemical fusing chamber.\n\nCell culture and seeding on fiber networks\n\n3T3 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Corning) supplemented with 10\\% fetal bovine serum (Corning) in T25 flasks (Thermo Scientific). The cells were grown in an incubator kept at 37C and 5% CO2. The nanofiber network scaffolds were tacked on a cover glass (VWR, 24 x 60mm No. 1.5) with the help of high-vacuum grease (Dow Corning). Next, the scaffolds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 10 minutes followed by Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS) washes (two times). Next, the scaffold was coated with 4 ug/mL bovine fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for at least one hour to promote cell adhesion. Cells were then seeded onto the scaffolds with a seeding density of 300,000 cells/mL and were allowed to spread onto the fibers for a few hours followed by the addition of 3 mL of media. Cells were allowed to further spread for an additional 24 hours before fixation.\n\nImmunostaining cells on fiber networks \n\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Santa Cruz Chemicals) for 15minutes. The cells were then washed with PBS two times and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution. Following two PBS washes the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum (Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes. Next, conjugated antibody Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin (1:100, Thermo Fisher) diluted in antibody dilution buffer was added to the cells. After one hour, the cells were washed with PBS (3x, 5 minutes each). The sample was then covered in 2 mL of Live Cell Imaging Media (Thermo Fisher) for imaging.",

        "release_date": "2024-04-01",
        "description": "Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density. ",

For the whole embryos obtained previously (47) that are used in this study, the first and last 3rd cleavage divisions occur between 0 and 2 h from each other. To compare the timing of whole embryos and doublets, we used the mean delay between cleavage divisions of whole embryos as the time after 3rd cleavage.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the contact angle of cell-cell contacts in whole embryos and doublets. Using the angle tool, the equatorial plane in which two contacting cells are observed is chosen to manually measure the external contact angle. Data of compacting whole WT embryos are taken from freely available time lapse images obtained previously (47).\nTo measure the size of contacts on doublets, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure length of contact at its equatorial plane.\nTo measure the size of micropipettes, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure the inner diameter near the tip.\n\nImmunostaining\nDoublets are imaged and synchronized using the 3rd cleavage division from 4- to 8-cell stage before being fixed and stained.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the intensity of Cdh1 and filamentous actin (phalloidin) in doublets to determine their distribution (i) at the cell-cell contact vs the cell-medium interfaces, (ii) at the contact rim vs central disc and (iii) at the contact edge vs inner contact.\n(i) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact and cell-medium interface, we measured the intensity Icc at cell-cell contacts and intensities Icm1 and Icm2 at the free surface of contacting cells 1 and 2. A 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line is manually drawn at the equatorial plane of the cell doublet to measure the mean intensities Icc, Icm1 and Icm2 at the corresponding interfaces.\n(ii) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact rim and central disc, we measured the intensities Idisc and Iring, with the latter one defined as a 1 \u00b5m thick circle at the rim of the contact. A 4 \u00b5m wide rectangle is drawn along the cell-cell contact to project it along the z axis using 3D project and interpolation functions of FIJI. On the projection, a circle is manually drawn around the entire cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. A 2 \u00b5m smaller circle is then positioned onto the center of the cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. To calculate the mean intensity Idisc, the total intensity of the small circle is divided by its area. To calculate the mean intensity Iring, the total intensity of the small circle is subtracted to the one of the large circle, the resulting intensity is divided by the area of the large circle to which the area of the small circle is subtracted.\n(iii) To account for the potential influence of depth of imaging in the analysis of the ring enrichment, we also performed a 2D analysis of Cdh1 and actin reorganization at the contact. Using a circle of radius 1 \u00b5m centered on the edge of contact, we measure the intensities of signal at both contact edges Iedge1 and Iedge2 of the equatorial plane of contact. We then measure intensity along the inner part of the cell-cell contact Iinner contact (excluding the edges) using a 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line. We then calculate the ratio between the average Iedge1 and Iedge2 and the Iinner contact.\n"

Technical details and detailed working principle are extensively described elsewhere (Prevedel et al., 2016)\u2060. The main difference with respect to the microscope design published by Prevedel et al. (2016) was a higher repetition laser (10 MHz, FemtoTrain, Spectra Physics). Laser power while scanning was kept below 191 mW, measured after the objective, to avoid heating the brain tissue excessively (Prevedel et al., 2016)\u2060. 470 \u03bcm2 fields of view were imaged at 128 px2 resolution and spaced in 15 \u03bcm z steps to cover 570 \u03bcm in depth (38 z steps) at a volume rate of 4.01 Hz. Artifacts produced by objective piezo z drive flyback were excluded from analysis.\n\tIn a typical imaging session, cranial window implanted mice were briefly (< 1 min) anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 for quick head fixation at a custom stage, slightly restraining their bodies inside a 5 cm diameter acrylic tube, and positioned under our custom 2P microscope. Mice fully recovered from the brief isoflurane anesthesia, showing a clear blinking reflex, whisking and sniffing behaviors and normal body posture and movements, immediately after head fixation. A pilot group of mice were habituated to the head fixed condition in daily 20 min sessions for 3 days, however we did not observe a marked contrast in the behavior of habituated versus unhabituated mice during our relatively short 25 min imaging sessions. In consequence imaging sessions never surpassed a maximum of 25 min, after which the mouse was returned to its home cage. Typically, mice were imaged a total of 2-11 times (sessions), one to three times a week. Volumetric imaging data was visualized and rendered using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012)\u2060. Motion correction was performed using NoRMCorre (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017)\u2060 on individual imaging planes from the volumetric datasets. jRGECO1a signal was extracted, denoised and neuropil corrected from each individual imaging plane using CaImAn (Giovannucci et al., 2019)\u2060.

                        "protocol_description": "- Animals and ethics statement:\n\tThis work was performed in compliance to the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU) to minimize animal pain and discomfort. EMBL\u2019s committee for animal welfare and institutional animal care and use (IACUC) approved all experimental procedures under protocol number 2019-04-15RP. Experiments were performed on 7-16-week-old CBA/j mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories and housed in groups of 1-5 in makrolon type 2L cages on ventilated racks at room temperature and 50% humidity with a 12 hr light cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum.\n\n- Surgical procedures:\nFor microscopy:\n\tCranial window surgeries were performed on 7-8-week-old mice of either sex following procedures published elsewhere (Boffi et al., 2018)\u2060. Briefly, anesthesia consisted of a mixture of 40 \u00b5l fentanyl (0.1 mg/ml; Janssen), 160 \u00b5l midazolam (5 mg/ml; Hameln) and 60 \u00b5l medetomidin (1 mg/ml; Pfizer), dosed in 5 \u00b5l/g body weight and injected i.p.. Hair removal cream was used to remove the fur over the scalp of anesthetized mice and eye ointment was applied (Bepanthen, Bayer). 1% xylocain (AstraZeneca) was injected as preincisional anesthesia under the scalp. Prepared mice were then placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, model 963) with their bodies on a heating pad (37\u00b0C). The scalp was surgically removed to expose the dorsal cranium. The periosteum was removed with fine forceps and scissors to prepare the surface for cranial window implantation and stereotaxic delivery of viral vectors. Post-surgical pain relief was provided (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim) through s.c. injections (0.1 mg/ml, dosed 10\u03bcl/g body weight).\n\tThe Ca2+ indicator jRGECO1a (Dana et al., 2016)\u2060 was expressed in IC neurons through induction with AAV vectors (Addgene #100854-AAV1), which were stereotaxically delivered as follows. A 4mm diameter circular craniectomy centered over IC (~1mm posterior to lambda (34)\u2060) was produced using a dental drill (Microtorque, Harvard Apparatus) with care to avoid bleeding and damage of the dura, which was not removed and left intact. Stereotaxic injections were performed at the right IC (from bregma: -5.2 mm AP, 0.5 mm ML) with pulled glass pipettes lowered to depths of 300, 400 and 500 \u03bcm, at a rate of ~4ul/hr using a syringe. ~300nl were injected per site. After injection, the craniectomy was sealed with a round 4mm coverslip (~170\u03bcm thick, disinfected with 70% ethanol), with a drop of saline between the glass and the dura, and dental acrylic cement (Hager Werken Cyano Fast and Paladur acrylic powder). A head fixation bar was also cemented. The open skin wound was also closed with acrylic cement. At the end of the surgery anesthesia was antagonized with a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of 120 \u00b5l sterile saline, 800 \u00b5l flumazenil (0.1 mg/ml; Fresenius Kabi), and 60 \u00b5l atipamezole (5 mg/ml; Pfizer) dosed in 10 \u00b5l/g body weight. Mice were single housed after surgery and were allowed to recover for at least 4 weeks before imaging, providing time for Ca2+ indicator expression and for the inflammation associated with this surgery to resolve (Holtmaat et al., 2009)\u2060.\n\nFor electrophysiology:\n\tAcute craniectomy surgeries were performed on 7-15-week-old mice of either sex following procedures published elsewhere (Boffi et al., 2018)\u2060. Briefly, anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane (Baxter) in O2, and maintained at 1.5-2% with a flow rate of 0.4-0.6 LPM. Hair removal cream was used to remove the fur over the scalp, eye ointment was applied (Bepanthen, Bayer) and 1% xylocain (AstraZeneca) was injected under the scalp as preincisional anesthesia. Mice were set in the stereotaxic apparatus with their bodies on a heating pad (37\u00b0C) and their scalp and periosteum removed to expose the dorsal cranium. A custom made head bar was cemented to the exposed cranium, sealing the skin wound, with UV cured dental acrylic to reduce curing time (Loctite 4305 LC). A ~4mm diameter circular craniectomy centered over IC (~1mm posterior to lambda (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001)\u2060) was produced using a dental drill (Microtorque, Harvard Apparatus) with care to avoid bleeding and damage of the dura. The surface of the brain was kept moist at all times with sterile cortex buffer (mM: NaCl 125, KCl 5, Glucose 10, Hepes 10, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, pH 7.4). The dura was carefully ripped open at a small site over DCIC for electrode insertion, through an incision made with a sterile G27 needle. The dura was not completely removed and the rest was left intact. Post-surgical pain relief was provided (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim) through s.c. injections (0.1 mg/ml, dosed 10\u03bcl/g body weight).\n\t Craniectomy surgeries typically lasted 30 min since the induction of anesthesia, after which the mouse was allowed to recover headfixed at the recording setup (same as for Ca2+ imaging, see below). Typically ~5 minutes after isoflurane removal the mice displayed awake behaviors like whisking, blinking, grooming and body movements. The craniectomy was kept submerged in a well of cortex buffer throughout the experiment. We began recording at least 40 minutes after the mouse showed signs of being fully awake. During this period the neuropixel probe was inserted into the DCIC at 10mm/s rate using a micromanipulatior (Sutter MPC-385 system, coupled to a Sensapex uMp-NPH Neuropixel 1.0 probe holder). After insertion, neuropixel probes were allowed to settle in the tissue for 10 min. The metal  headbar was left exposed to the cortex buffer close to the edge of the craniectomy and was used as  reference.",

They feature an immunohistochemical staining of neuronal cell bodies (HuC/HuD), cell nuclei (TO-PRO-3), myelinated neurites (Myelin Basic Protein), and an autofluorescence channel. For all channels, we provide cell-level datasets including sensory cortical areas on cellular level (0.54 x 0.54 x 4\u00b5m XYZ). The data provide insight into cell distribution, cell densities and fibre directions in the neocortex.\n",

Image data were acquired in a 2x3 stack mosaic acquisition, including primary auditory and primary visual cortex and surrounding areas. Light sheet NA was set to 0.165 (minimum sheet thickness 3.4\u00b5m), with a sheet width of 40% (~1.2cm) and an exposure time of 97 ms. Laser power for the respective lasers were set to 7.5mW (488nm), 22.5mW (555nm), 3.25mW (640nm), 75mW (785nm). To minimize a potential bias from the optical system, all samples but one were scanned with light sheets from the right side. \n",

The orientation of the membranes was tracked (blue sticks) and their coherency was computed. Local coherencies were visualized as thin red sticks of a certain length and angle emphasized by background colour. Global coherencies where shown as thick red sticks. Density functions revealed the distribution of local coherencies and the resulting mean local coherency and global coherency. The directions of local coherencies within each ROI were plotted as polar histograms respecting the 180-degree-symmetry and showed the computed angle of the global coherency. ",

Subsequently, eyes were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) for light microscopy (LM) analysis at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Eyes were washed in PBS before the cornea was punctured with a 30 G x 0.5 needle. Cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous were removed with a pair of micro scissors and curved forceps. Remaining muscle tissue around the sclera was gently removed and the optic nerve cut as short as possible. \nAfter dissection, the eyecup containing sclera, choroid, RPE and retina was cryopreserved overnight at 4 \u00b0C in a 30% (weight/volume) sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) solution and embedded in optimal cutting medium (OCT, NEG50, Thermo Scientific) inside of Tissue-Tek Cryomolds. Samples were sectioned at 20 \u00b5m thickness using a CryoStarTM NX70 cryostat. Serial transverse sections were collected on SuperfrostTM Plus Adhesion Microscopy Slides, air-dried for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and stored at -70\u00b0C.\nSlides with sections for antibody staining were air-dried for 30 min and rehydrated in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. During rehydration slides were covered with ShandonTM coverplates and placed into ShandonTM SequenzaTM racks. Next, slides were incubated in blocking buffer (0.3 % Triton X100, 5 % Donkey or Goat Serum, and 1 % BSA (Serva GmBH, 11926.04) dissolved in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Peripherin2, Thermo Scientific, 1:200; S-opsin, Santa Cruz, sc-14363, 1:200; PNA, Vector Laboratories, B-1075, 1:1000; M-opsin, Millipore, AB5405, 1:1000) dissolved in blocking buffer at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The slides were kept at room temperature for 30 min and washed with PBS. Afterwards, the tissue was incubated with secondary antibodies (Donkey-Anti-Rabbit-Cy2, Jackson IR, 711-225-152; Donkey-Anti-Goat-Cy3, Jackson IR, 705-165-147; Donkey-Anti-Rabbit-Cy5, Jackson IR, 711-175-152; Straptavidin-Alexa-488, Invitrogen, S11223, all diluted 1:1000) and DAPI nuclear staining solution (1:5000) dissolved in PBS. Then, slides were washed extensively in PBS and water before mounting with AquaPolymount (Polyscience, 18606) and a 24x50 mm #1.5 coverslip. Finally, slides were stored at 4\u00b0C after air drying at room temperature in a dark place overnight. \n",

The model was trained on 21 images from a postnatal development series. After the model was trained its performance was tested by computing a confusion matrix. \n\nThe trained model was then applied to analyse POS during postnatal development as well POS degneration in a mouse model for cone photoreceptor loss (Cpfl1) in comparison to age-matched WT control animals.

        "release_date": "2024-04-11",
        "description": "While commensal bacteria generally respect natural barriers of the human body, pathogens are able to breach epithelia, invade deeper tissue layers and cause life-threatening infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen, is a leading cause of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, with mortality rates up to 50% in mechanically ventilated patients1\u20133. Effective colonization and breaching of lung mucosa are hallmarks of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis4. Although virulence factors and behavioral strategies of P. aeruginosa have been described5,6, it has remained unclear how this pathogen disseminates on functional mucosal surfaces, how it avoids mucociliary clearance and how it invades the tissue barrier. Using fully differentiated human lung epithelia, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa efficiently spreads on the apical tissue surface before it breaches epithelia by preferentially invading mucus secreting goblet cells. Internalization leads to host cell death and expulsion and the formation of ruptures of the epithelial barrier. Rupture sites are rapidly colonized by extracellular bacteria through active chemotaxis, leading to increasing tissue damage and successful pathogen translocation to the unprotected basolateral side of the epithelium. We show that cell invasion is promoted by two Type-6 toxin secretion systems (T6SS), while Type-3 (T3SS) mediates cell death of infected goblet cells. T3SS mutants invade goblet cells normally, but internalized bacteria fail to trigger goblet cell expulsion and instead show unrestrained intracellular replication. While the effective shedding of infected host cells reveals potent tissue protection mechanisms, the discovery of an intracellular lifestyle of P. aeruginosa in pseudostratified human lung epithelia provides new entry points into investigating the intersection of antibiotic and immune mechanisms during lung infections. By demonstrating that P. aeruginosa uses a combination of specific virulence factors and collective behavior to invade goblet cells and breach the lung tissue barrier from within, these studies reveal novel mechanisms underlying lung infection dynamics under physiological conditions.

Samples were post-fixed in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, rinsed in buffer, rinsed in water, then en bloc stained with aqueous Uranyl Acetate for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 95% and 100%). After three changes of absolute ethanol, samples were washed in acetone and embedded in a mixture of resin/acetone first and then in pure Epon 812 resin overnight. Embedding is carried out into an oven at 60\u00b0C for 48 hours. Semi-thin sections are cut from blocks with a glass knife and the blocks are selected for thinning. Seventy nm thin sections were cut with diamond knives and placed on copper grids, coated with Parlodion film and carbon layer, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired using an EMSIS Veleta camera (top, side-mounted).",

        "description": "Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to cilia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for DLG1, a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, the retromer-associated protein SDCCAG3, IFT20 and polycystin-2 (PC2) were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 variant, p.T489R. Finally, biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling suggested that SDCCAG3 and IFT20 form a complex that associates, at least indirectly, with DLG1. Our work identifies a key role for DLG1 in regulating ciliary protein composition and suggests that ciliary dysfunction of the p.T489R DLG1 variant may contribute to CAKUT.  ",
