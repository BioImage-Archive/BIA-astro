        "description": "In Drosophila male gonads, niche-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has a role in maintaining stem cells in close proximity but the range of Dpp diffusion and its role has never been tested in the differentiating cells spaced one-cell layer away. Here, using genetically encoded nanobodies called Morphotraps, we physically block Dpp diffusion without interfering with niche-stem cell signaling and find that a diffusible fraction of Dpp is required to ensure differentiation of GSC daughter cells, opposite of its role in maintenance of GSC in the niche. Our work provides an example in which a soluble niche ligand induces opposed cellular responses in stem cells versus differentiating descendants to ensure spatial control of the niche, which may be a common mechanism to regulate tissue homeostasis.",

        "release_date": "2024-01-08",
        "description": "This dataset comprises the raw data associated with Wong et al., EMBO J., 2024. \"Regulation of centrosome size by the cell cycle oscillator in Drosophila embryos\". This dataset (approximately 900Gb in total) tracks the behavior of individual centrosomes (labelled with different centrosome markers) in early Drosophila embryos during nuclear cycles 11-13 under various conditions. The datasets are organised to align with each individual Figure shown in the paper. \n\nThe paper abstract is: Mitotic centrosomes assemble when centrioles recruit large amounts of pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. In early C. elegans embryos, mitotic centrosome size appears to be set by the limiting amount of a key component. In Drosophila syncytial embryos, thousands of mitotic centrosomes are assembled as the embryo proceeds through 13 rounds of rapid nuclear division, driven by a core cell-cycle oscillator. These divisions slow during nuclear cycles 11-13, and we find that centrosomes respond by reciprocally decreasing their growth rate, but increasing their growth period\u2014so that they grow to a relatively consistent size at each cycle. At the start of each cycle, moderate CCO activity initially promotes centrosome growth, in part by stimulating Polo/PLK1 recruitment to centrosomes. Later in each cycle, high CCO activity inhibits centrosome growth by suppressing the centrosomal recruitment and/or maintenance of centrosome proteins. Thus, in fly embryos, mitotic centrosome size appears to be regulated predominantly by the core cell-cycle oscillator, rather than by the depletion of a limiting component.",

The imzML file was then loaded into LipostarMSI with specific parameters: 3ppm m/z tolerance, peak intensity >1%, peak detection frequency >1%, and minimum spatial chaos >0.7. Hotspot removal was applied using the 99% quantile, and no denoising was performed. For internal normalization, m/z 121.0444 was utilized for d4-succinic acid.\n\nMSI data was uploaded to LipostarMSI and peak picked and processed using the above parameters. We then checked the image each individually picked ion to assess if it had a reasonable distribution across any on-tissue areas. If a distribution and signal was present, we cross referenced this ion mass with an in-house library of standards and from Metaspace annotations for identification, with a mass error acceptance of 3ppm.

        "description": "Morphological modifications and shifts in organelle relationships are hallmarks of dormancy in eukaryotic cells. Communications between altered mitochondria and nuclei are associated with metabolic quiescence of cancer cells that can survive chemotherapy. In plants, changes in the pathways between nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are associated with cold stress and bud dormancy. Plasmodium falciparum parasites, the deadliest agent of malaria in humans, contain a chloroplast-like organelle (apicoplast) derived from an ancient photosynthetic symbiont. Antimalarial treatments can fail because a small fraction of the blood stage parasites enter dormancy and recrudesce after drug exposure. Altered mitochondrial-nuclear interactions in these persisters have been described for P. falciparum, but interactions of the apicoplast remained to be characterized. In the present study, we examined the apicoplasts of dormant persisters obtained after exposure to dihydroartemisinin (a first-line antimalarial drug) followed by sorbitol treatment, or after exposure to sorbitol treatment alone. As previously observed, the mitochondrion of persisters was consistently enlarged and in close association with the nucleus. In contrast, the apicoplast varied from compact and oblate, like those of active ring stage parasites, to enlarged and irregularly shaped. Enlarged apicoplasts became more prevalent later in dormancy, but regular size apicoplasts subsequently predominated when actively replicating parasites recrudesced. All three organelles, nucleus, mitochondrion, and apicoplast, became closer during dormancy. Understanding their relationships in erythrocytic-stage persisters may lead to new strategies to prevent recrudescences and protect the future of malaria chemotherapy.",

High-content microscopy is indispensable in the drug discovery process but the sensitivity relies on the accuracy of mature synapse detection. We present a workflow whereby synchronous calcium bursting is measured in GCaMP6f-transduced neurons. The same cultures are then subjected to Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) to label mature synapses, the neurite network and nuclei. The integration of functional and morphological information provides a rich fingerprint of neuronal connectivity, deployable in different experimental conditions. ",

        "release_date": "2023-12-15",
        "description": "In 2015, we launched the mesoSPIM initiative (www.mesospim.org), an open-source project for making light-sheet microscopy of large cleared tissues more accessible. Meanwhile, the demand for imaging larger samples at higher speed and resolution has increased, requiring major improvements in the capabilities of light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce the next-generation mesoSPIM (\"Benchtop\") with significantly increased field of view, improved resolution, higher throughput, more affordable cost and simpler assembly compared to the original version. We developed a new method for testing objectives, enabling us to select detection objectives optimal for light-sheet imaging with large-sensor sCMOS cameras. The new mesoSPIM achieves high spatial resolution (1.5 \u00b5m laterally, 3.3 \u00b5m axially) across the entire field of view, a magnification up to 20x, and supports sample sizes ranging from sub-mm up to several centimetres, while being compatible with multiple clearing techniques. The new microscope serves a broad range of applications in neuroscience, developmental biology, and even physics.",

        "description": "Molecular interactions are key to all cellular processes, and particularly interesting to investigate in the context of gene regulation. Protein\u2013protein interactions are challenging to examine in vivo as they are dynamic, and require spatially and temporally resolved studies to interrogate them. Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a highly sensitive imaging method, which can interrogate molecular interactions. FRET can be detected by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM-FRET), which is more robust to concentration variations and photobleaching than intensity-based FRET but typically needs long acquisition times to achieve high photon counts. New variants of non-fitting lifetime-based FRET perform well in samples with lower signal and require less intensive instrument calibration and analysis, making these methods ideal for probing protein\u2013protein interactions in more complex live 3D samples. Here we show that a non-fitting FLIM-FRET variant, based on the Average Arrival Time of photons per pixel (AAT\u2212 FRET), is a sensitive and simple way to detect and measure protein\u2013protein interactions in live early stage zebrafish embryos.",

For some images, mCitrine/mCherry intensity channels were used to verify/carry out segmentation. Background subtraction using a rolling ball radius of \u223c10 pixels and Gaussian blur of \u223c0.9 \u03bcm were performed on the SiR-DNA channel (settings varied for embryos with different SiR-DNA signal patterns). The resultant stack was used to perform 3D nuclear segmentation was carried out using Trackmate with the built-in StarDist detector (Ershov et al. 2022). 2D ROIs representing segmented nuclei detected on each z-planes were filtered by manual thresholding of radius, signal-to-noise, and quality features, as well as manual inspection to remove false detections. The remaining detections were linked together using the Trackmate overlap tracker to create a 3D label stack, which was used to extract the pixel intensity and AAT values for each nucleus from original image stack using the 3D ImageJ Suite.36, 37 For single z-planes pre-/post-bleach images, nuclei were segmented manually (Fiji or LAS-X), and pixel intensity and AAT values were extracted for each nucleus.\nNucleus ROI data from Fiji processing, giving an intensity and AAT value per pixel were imported into Python 338 and processed using Pandas39 and NumPy.40 Plots were made using Seaborn.41 Pixels were binned into 0.1 ns AAT bins (matching the detector resolution), and pixel intensities for each AAT bin summed, creating an AAT versus intensity plot for individual ROIs. These match the AAT plots imported from nuclei segmented in LAS-X. AAT plots were normalised to an intensity of 1, averaged across each condition and re-normalised to create line graphs for visual comparison. The mean-weighted AAT per nucleus was calculated from individual ROI AAT plots using the calculation :\nmean weighted AAT = total (AAT x (I/Imax))/total ((I/Imax)), where I is the Intensity at a given AAT (sum of photons counted in pixels with given AAT) and Imax is the maximum Intensity value for a given ROI.\nmfD was calculated per pixel from AAT values. Mean weighted mfD was calculated as for Mean Weighted AAT:\nmfD = 1-(AAT:D+A/total(mean weighted AAT:D)/((AAT:D+A/2(total(mean weighted AAT:D))-1)^2.\nmfD and mean weighted mfD values <0 were set to 0, as the minimum fraction cannot be lower than 0%.\nIntensity-based and lifetime-based FRET Efficiency were calculated: \n E = 1-I:D+A/I:D\nwhere I:D+A is the is the average nuclear intensity of the donor in presence of the acceptor from across all 3 embryos and I:D is the average nuclear intensity of the donor alone.\nE = 1- \u03c4:D+A/ \u03c4:D\nwhere \u03c4:D+A is the average AAT of the donor in presence of the acceptor from nuclei across all 3 embryos and \u03c4:D is the average AAT of the donor alone.\nIntensity-based apparent FRET efficiency was calculated for acceptor photobleaching: E = 1- I:D+A(pre-bleach)/I:D+A(post-bleach)."

        "description": "A novel automated imaging-based method to detect inhibition of angiogenesis in early life stage zebrafish. Video subtraction was used to identify the location and number of functional intersegmental vessels according to the detection of moving blood cells. By exposing embryos to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors including SU4312, SU5416, Sorafenib, or PTK787, we confirmed that this method can detect concentration-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis. The new test method showed higher sensitivity, i.e. lower effect concentrations, relative to a fluorescent reporter gene strain (Tg(KDR:EGFP)) exposed to the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Indicating that functional effects due to altered tubulogenesis or blood transport can be detected before structural changes of the endothelium are visible by fluorescence imaging. Comparison of exposure windows indicated higher specificity for angiogenesis when exposure started at later embryonic stages (24 hours post fertilization). Our findings establish video imaging in wild-type strains as viable, non-invasive, high-throughput method for the detection of chemical-induced angiogenic disruption in zebrafish embryos. We established a lable-free and non-invasive method to visualize the blood vessel network in the developing wild type zebrafish embryo. We quantified ISV inhibition by comparing WT control, treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (SU4312, SU5416, Sorafenib and PTK787) and a fluorescent strain (TG(KDR:EGFP)). Dose-response curves and EC50 values were determined by KNIME-Workflows",

The FishInspector software allows to automatically annotate morphological features including body contour, eye, lower mouth tip, pericard, otoliths, notochord, swimbladder, and yolk and to calculate diverse metrics such as feature length, size, curvature indices, or angle between feature-connecting lines. In contrast to the previously published version, FishInspector 1.70 detects morphological features based on a deep learning approach using the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox and Matlab Image Processing Toolbox (Mathworks, Natick, MS). In addition, metric calculation were included into the software, and meta information such as test compound, exposure window or test concentration was associated to each image using a microplate layout file. To facilitate training of the models, two additional programs were generated in Matlab including FishTrainer 0.9 (for training of semantic segmentation models of structural features) and FishClassificator 0.9 (for training of position classes to be used in automated flipping of images). For image training, image size was adjusted to 450 x 300 pixel to reduce computing time. This resolution was sufficient to detect the selected features (data not shown). For training of the deep learning models, approximately 3000 previously annotated images (Teixid\u00f3 et al. 2022) were used. The automated annotations were corrected by the user in the event that they were not adequately detecting visible structures. User-bias was avoided by a blinded assessment of images. Following model training, experimental images used for annotation had a resolution of 1024 x 190 pixels\n\nFishInspector provided a JSON file corresponding to each image file containing the coordinates of all features and the applied smoothing factor. For each image, a csv file was generated containing calculated metrics. The software automatically provides a summary table containing metrics r of individual embryos. All experimental images and corresponding csv files can be found in Supplementary Material. All subsequent analyses were conducted using the summary excel file and a KNIME workflows with embedded R-scripts, as previously described (Teixid\u00f3 et al. 2022). The KNIME workflow (all workflows are available via https://git.ufz.de/automated-fish-embryotest/zebrafish-embryo-crc/zebrafish-isv) will be provided after publication) converted pixel metrics into \u00b5m or \u00b5m\u00b2, combined results from different replicates, and conducted concentration response analysis to calculate effect concentrations (EC10 and EC50).

TFish were fed twice daily with dry food (SDS-400, Special Diets Services, Essex England) and once daily with Artemia sp. Fish were cultured under 14h light/10h dark photoperiod in 20 L aquaria with 1-2 fish per liter density (26.5\u00b11 \u00b0C). Water quality parameters were pH 7\u20138; water hardness 2\u20133 mmol/L, conductivity 540\u2013560 S/cm, nitrate < 2.5 mg/L, nitrite < 0.025 mg/L, ammonia < 0.6 mg/L, oxygen saturation 87\u201391 %. Spawning trays were inserted 4-6 hours before the end of the light cycle. The following day, spawning was initiated by the onset of light and eggs were collected within 1 h. Exposure in all experiment was ceased at 96 hpf. Facilities for breeding and the production of embryos were licensed by Landesdirektion Leipzig (Aktenzeichen 75-9185.64).\nFertilized and normally developed embryos were selected according to Kimmel et al. (Kimmel et al. 1995) with a dissection microscope (Olympus SZx7-ILLT) at 1 hpf. Depending on experiment, exposure was started within 2-3 h post fertilization (16 to 128 cell stages) or at 24 hpf. Exposure was conducted in rectangular 96-well microplates (Clear Polystyrene, flat bottom, Uniplate, Whatman, GE Healthcare) covered by a lid with a test volume of 400 \u00b5L of exposure media. For each replicate one embryo per well and 16 wells per concentration were assessed. Experiments were performed with at least two replicates on independent days and breeding.\n"

For general image acquisition, image size was set to 4096 x 4096 pixels, with a per-pixel scaling of 0.10 \u03bcm x 0.10 \u03bcm on a Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 objective at 1X zoom. Unidirectional scan speed was set to provide a 0.68 \u03bcs pixel-dwell, and bit-depth and averaging were set to 16. Per fluorophore, the following emission wavelength cutoffs were used: NucBlue (411-450 nm), sfGFP (491-534 nm), mCherry (580-632 nm), and Alexa iFluor 647 phalloidin (640-701 nm). Pinholes were set to 1 Airy Unit (AU). To generate 3D models, a 40X variant of this method with z-stacks (10 \u03bcm of tissue; 0.33 \u03bcm slice spacing) and tiling was used. In replicating GAP studies, a Zeiss Axio Observer was also used.\n\n\tImage processing was performed in Zen Blue and Zen Black, with deconvolution of sfGFP and mCherry performed in ImageJ. Diffraction PSF 3D was used to generate PSFs, and Deconvolution Lab (Sage et al., 2017) was used to perform Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding (5 iterations, \u03b3 = 1, \u03bb = 0.1, wavelets = spline 3, and scale = 3). A bandpass Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used for size-based exclusion of lumen background. In Zen Blue, the following sequential steps and corresponding thresholds were used: Background Subtraction (150), Single Pixel Filter (1.5), Gauss (1.15), and Unsharp Mask (0.5). After Min/Max autoscaling of the histograms, this file was saved as a TIFF to have HDR applied in sampling mode with an intensity of 2 in Zen Black.\n\n\tFor RNAScope-based assays, an Airyscan (CO) protocol was developed. Image size was set to 1024 x 1024 pixels, with a per-pixel scaling of 0.07 \u03bcm x 0.07 \u03bcm on a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective at 2X zoom, with 0.02 \u03bcm x 0.02 \u03bcm per-pixel scaling and 8X zoom used for inset magnifications. Pixel dwell was set to 2.05 \u03bcs and averaging was set to 8 for acquisition of 16-bit images. Per laser line, the following pinholes were used: 405 nm (2.94 AU), 514 nm (2.21 AU), 543 nm (1 AU), and 633 nm (1 AU). Images were processed with four-component linear unmixing and bandpass FFT prior to saving as TIFF for HDR application.\n\n        For histopathological image generation and analysis (AB/PAS), Hamamatsu Photonics NDP.scan was employed for complete slide scanning. For counting goblet cells and determining crypt lengths, resulting images were analyzed with Hamamatsu Photonics NDP-view2.\n",

        "release_date": "2023-12-22",
        "description": "The shaping of human embryos begins with compaction, during which cells come into close contact. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) studies suggest that human embryos fail compaction primarily because of defective adhesion. Based on our current understanding of animal morphogenesis, other morphogenetic engines, such as cell contractility, could be involved in shaping human embryos. However, the molecular, cellular and physical mechanisms driving human embryo morphogenesis remain uncharacterized. Using micropipette aspiration on human embryos donated to research, we have mapped cell surface tensions during compaction. This reveals a 4-fold increase of tension at the cell-medium interface while cell-cell contacts keep a steady tension. Therefore, increased tension at the cell-medium interface drives human embryo compaction, which is qualitatively similar to compaction in mouse embryos. Further comparison between human and mouse reveals qualitatively similar but quantitively different mechanical strategies, with human embryos being mechanically least efficient. Inhibition of cell contractility and cell-cell adhesion in human embryos reveals that, while both cellular processes are required for compaction, only contractility controls the surface tensions responsible for compaction. Interestingly, cell contractility and cell-cell adhesion exhibit distinct mechanical signatures when faulty. Analyzing the mechanical signature of naturally failing embryos, we find evidence that non-compacting or partially compacting embryos containing excluded cells have defective contractility. Together, our study reveals that an evolutionarily conserved increase in cell contractility is required to generate the forces driving the first morphogenetic movement shaping the human body.",

In brief, the equatorial plane of the object is taken to manually draw a line between the inner walls of the pipette or a circle fitting the cell-medium interface of cells. To measure external contact angles, two line segments are drawn tangentially to the cell-medium interfaces of two contacting cells with their intersection located at the cell-cell contact edge (Fig 1a). Similarly, to measure internal contact angles, two line segments are drawn: one along the cell-cell contact and another tangentially to the cell-medium interface of one of the contacting cells (Fig 1a). As an internal control of the measurement, we verify that the three angles roughly sum up to 360\u00b0 (with a tolerance of 10\u00b0).\nTo measure cortical intensity, as done previously7, we picked confocal slices cutting through the equatorial plane of two contacting cells using Fiji. We drew a 1 \u03bcm thick line along the cell-medium interface or cell-cell contact, measured the mean intensity and divided the contact intensity by the sum of the cell-medium intensities of contacting cells.\nTo measure the volume of cells, we use Bitplane Imaris to draw the contour of cells along the F-actin signal on confocal slices of stained embryos, as done previously7.\n"

        "release_date": "2023-10-13",
        "description": "Motile cells encounter microenvironments of locally heterogeneous mechanochemical composition. Individual compositional parameters like chemokines and pore sizes are well known to provide guidance cues for pathfinding. However, motile cells face diverse cues at the same time, raising the question of how they respond to diverse and potentially competing signals on their paths. Here, we reveal that amoeboid cells require nuclear repositioning, termed nucleokinesis, for adaptive pathfinding in heterogeneous mechanochemical micro-environments. Using mammalian immune cells and the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we discover that frequent, rapid and long-distance nucleokinesis is a basic component of amoeboid pathfinding, enabling cells to reorientate quickly between locally competing cues. Amoeboid nucleokinesis comprises a two-step polarity switch and is driven by myosin-II forces, readjusting the nuclear to the cellular path. Impaired nucleokinesis distorts path adaptions and causes cellular arrest in the microenvironment. Our findings establish that nucleokinesis is required for amoeboid cell navigation. Given that many immune cells, amoebae, and some cancer cells utilize an amoeboid migration strategy, these results suggest that nucleokinesis underlies cellular navigation during unicellular biology, immunity, and disease.\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.19.540965.

For the membrane model, preliminary segmentations of cell boundaries were initially generated using the lamin B1 workflow from the Segmenter. The \u201cCurator\u201d tool from the Segmenter was used to mask out areas of the images that were not segmented accurately. The original membrane model was trained on a dataset of 14 neuromasts labeled with Tg(-8.0cldnb:LY-EGFP). The membrane model predictions were thresholded and used as input for an interactive distance transform watershed segmentation workflow. Upon generating the label images, the find_boundaries function from scikit-image was used to generate watershed lines, which was used as input to train a second membrane model with improved performance. This process was repeated once more with a new dataset of 9 Tg(-8.0cldnb:LY-EGFP) neuromasts stained with DRAQ5, except labeled nuclei were used to generate seeds for the watershed instead of the distance transform. The results were used to train the third membrane model, which was used for instance segmentation (delineation of individual objects) of all the images in this study.\n\tTo generate the nucleus mask model, the \u201cH2B coarse\u201d model provided by AICS22 was used to generate preliminary nucleus predictions. The predictions were thresholded, and the membrane intensity image (or membrane boundary predictions) were used to \u201csplit\u201d the nuclei (as described in \u201cInstance segmentation\u201d). Similar to the refinement for the membrane model, a distance transform watershed workflow was applied to thresholded nuclei predictions to generate labeled nuclei, which were converted to binary masks and used to train the first nucleus mask model. This process was repeated (starting from the model 1 predictions instead of the H2B coarse model predictions) to generate a second nucleus mask model with improved performance, which was used for all the images in this study.\n"

        "description": "Cell fragmentation is commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and is associated with poor prognosis during assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. However, the mechanisms leading to cell fragmentation remain largely unknown. Here, light sheet microscopy imaging of mouse embryos reveals that inefficient chromosome separation due to spindle defects, caused by dysfunctional molecular motors Myo1c or dynein, leads to fragmentation during mitosis. Extended exposure of the cell cortex to chromosomes locally triggers actomyosin contractility and pinches off cell fragments. This process is reminiscent of meiosis, during which small GTPase-mediated signals from chromosomes coordinate polar body extrusion (PBE) by actomyosin contraction. By interfering with the signals driving PBE, we find that this meiotic signaling pathway remains active during cleavage stages and is both required and sufficient to trigger fragmentation. Together, we find that fragmentation happens in mitosis after ectopic activation of actomyosin contractility by signals emanating from DNA, similar to those observed during meiosis. Our study uncovers the mechanisms underlying fragmentation in preimplantation embryos and, more generally, offers insight into the regulation of mitosis during the maternal-zygotic transition.",

A segmented line is used to define the size and the location of the LifeAct or Myh9-GFP cap. Starting at the first division timepoint the intensity is measured at the segmented line, with the length of the eventually formed cap, and the distance between the center of the DNA mass and the center of the segmented line. The intensity of another segmented line drawn with the same length on a different part of the cell-medium interface where no cortical fluctuations are observed is used to normalize the intensity. \n\nSpindle analysis\nSpindle persistence was calculated by measuring the time between the appearance and disappearance of the spindle. Spindle straightness was measured using FIJI by dividing the length of a straight line connecting spindle poles divided by the length of a broken line drawn along the spindle. For spindle rotation, the angle between the initial direction of one spindle pole and its maximal change of direction was measured.\n\nNuclear envelope reassembly\nThe time between nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly was measured based on the first time point where the nuclear envelope is not visible anymore until the time point where the nuclear envelope reappears. Cells from the same embryos are averaged together.\n\nStatistics \nData are plotted using GraphPad Prism. Statistical tests are performed using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10-2. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample that survived the experiment, as assessed by the continuation of cell divisions, was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments. \n"

        "release_date": "2023-03-01",
        "description": "The plant immune system relies on the perception of molecules that signal the presence of a microbe threat. This triggers signal transduction that mediates a range of cellular responses via a collection of molecular machinery including receptors, small molecules, and enzymes. One response to pathogen perception is the restriction of cell-to-cell communication by plasmodesmal closure. We previously found that while chitin and flg22 trigger specialized immune signaling cascades in the plasmodesmal plasma membrane, both execute plasmodesmal closure via callose synthesis at the plasmodesmata. This indicates the signaling pathways ultimately converge at or upstream of callose synthesis. To establish the hierarchy of signaling at plasmodesmata and characterize points of convergence in microbe elicitor-triggered signaling, we profiled the dependence of plasmodesmal responses triggered by different elicitors on a range of plasmodesmal signaling machinery. We identified that, like chitin, flg22 signals via RBOHD to induce plasmodesmal closure. Further, we found that PDLP1, PDLP5 and CALS1 are common to microbe- and SA-triggered responses, identifying PDLPs as a candidate signaling nexus. To understand how PDLPs relay a signal to CALS1, we screened for PDLP5 interactors and found NHL3, which is also required for chitin-, flg22- and SA-triggered plasmodesmal responses and PDLP-mediated activation of callose synthesis. We conclude that a PDLP-NHL3 complex acts as an integrating node of plasmodesmal signaling cascades, transmitting multiple immune signals to activate CALS1 and plasmodesmata closure.",

        "description": "FAM3C/ILEI is an important cytokine for tumor progression and metastasis. However, its involvement in inflammation remains elusive. Here, we show that ILEI protein is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions. Inducible keratinocyte-specific ILEI overexpression in mice (K5-ILEIind) recapitulates many aspects of psoriasis following TPA challenge, primarily manifested by impaired epidermal differentiation and increased neutrophil recruitment. Mechanistically, ILEI triggers Erk and Akt signaling, which then activate STAT3 via Ser727 phosphorylation. Keratinocyte-specific ILEI deletion ameliorates TPA-induced skin inflammation. A transcriptomic ILEI signature obtained from the K5-ILEIind model shows enrichment in several signaling pathways also found in psoriasis and identifies urokinase as a targetable enzyme to counteract ILEI activity. Pharmacological inhibition of urokinase in TPA-induced K5-ILEIind mice results in significant improvement of psoriasiform symptoms by reducing ILEI secretion. The ILEI signature distinguishes psoriasis from healthy skin with uPA ranking among the top \u201cseparator\u201d genes. Our study identifies ILEI as a key driver in psoriasis, indicates the relevance of ILEI-regulated genes for disease manifestation and shows the clinical impact of ILEI and urokinase as novel potential therapeutic targets in psoriasis.",

        "description": "Dynamic measurements of molecular machines can provide invaluable insights into their mechanism, but have been challenging in living cells. Here, we developed live-cell tracking of single fluorophores with nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution in 2D and 3D using the recently introduced super-resolution technique MINFLUX. This allowed us to resolve the precise stepping motion of the motor protein kinesin-1 as it walks on microtubules in living cells. In addition, nanoscopic tracking of motors walking on the microtubules of fixed cells enabled us to resolve the architecture of the microtubule cytoskeleton with protofilament resolution. Our approach will enable future in vivo studies of motor protein kinetics in complex environments and super-resolution mapping of dense microtubule arrays, and paves the way towards monitoring functional conformational changes of protein machines at high spatiotemporal resolution in living systems.",

        "description": "Bacteria encounter polymeric nutrient sources that need to be processed to support growth. Bacillus subtilis is a bacterium known for its adaptability and resilience within the rhizosphere and broader soil environment. Here we explore the role that a suite of extracellular proteases plays in supporting growth of B. subtilis when an extracellular heterologous protein (BSA) provides an abundant, but polymeric, food source. We confirm the essential role of extracellular proteases in this context and note the influence of the polymeric nutrient concentration on the yield of growth, but not on the relative level of extracellular proteases. We demonstrate the collective action of the extracellular proteases in supporting B. subtilis growth and evidence their use as a shared public good. Furthermore, we show that B. subtilis is subjected to a public good dilemma, but only in the context of using a polymeric food source. Using mathematical simulations, we uncover that this dilemma is driven by the relative cost of producing the public good. Collectively, our findings reveal how B. subtilis can survive in environments that vary significantly in terms of immediate nutrient accessibility. This information should inform steps to improve its efficacy as a biofertilizer in agricultural settings.",

        "description": "We present an imaging dataset used to study the regulation of the \"timer\" genes caudal (cad), Dichaete (D) and odd-paired (opa) in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos (accompanying manuscript: doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78902). The dataset consists of various multiplexed HCR and/or antibody stains showing the expression of relevant patterning genes in fixed Drosophila embryos (54 gene product combinations across 12 genotypes). In total it contains 866 multi-chanel image stacks, 818 of which show whole embryos, and 48 of which show close-up views of the posterior terminal region. We used the data to identify 11 new regulatory interactions involved in Drosophila anteroposterior patterning and to clarify the dynamics and mechanism of posterior terminal patterning.",
