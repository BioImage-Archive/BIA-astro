        "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

In adults we also studied the soft palate, and the geniculate and trigeminal ganglia, which extend afferent fibers to the anterior tongue. ",

Scan speed was at 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 1 Airy units, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 0.75 and 2. For z-stacks, 12 or 16 bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.33 \u03bcm with voxel size of 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.33 \u03bcm. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

        "description": "Understanding the dynamics and interactions of cellular components is crucial for biological research and drug discovery. Current dynamic fluorescence microscopy methods can only image a few fluorescent labels, providing a limited view of these complex processes. We developed Mantis, a high-throughput 3D microscope that maps interactions among components of dynamic cell systems. Mantis combines light-sheet fluorescence imaging of multiple fluorophores with quantitative label-free microscopy and is complemented by shrimPy, our open-source software for high-throughput data acquisition and high-performance analysis. Mantis enabled simultaneous 3D time-lapse imaging of 20 cell lines and quantitative analysis of responses to perturbations like viral infection at single-cell resolution. This approach can accelerate the analysis of cellular dynamics and image-based drug discovery.",

Histology and cryo-sectioning images were captured using a Keyence BZ-800 and BZ-X800 Viewer and Analyzer software. Images were processed using ZEN 2012 blue edition imaging software (Zeiss) or BZ-X800 Viewer and Analyzer software (Keyence). Images were analyzed using the Zeiss ZEN 2012 blue edition image software, and Photoshop (Adobe) was used to prepare the figure images.\n\nMicrotubule length and width measurements\nSpindle measurements were made using ZEN 2012 blue edition imaging software (Zeiss). The spindle length was obtained by measuring from where microtubule nucleation began at an MTOC to the aligned chromosomes on the metaphase I spindle. The width of the spindle was measured proximal to aligned chromosomes on the metaphase I spindle. The width and length of both spindles of a metaphase I spermatocyte were measured and reported as a ratio of A:B, with A being the smaller of the two length or width measurements (Fig 6B and D).\n\nData and statistical analysis\nAll graphics and statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. Each figure legend provides details of cell and animal counts and statistical analyses.\n",

        "release_date": "2024-05-17",
        "description": "We present a 3D digital atlas of Cardamine hirsuta ovule development with cellular resolution. The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth (stage 1-I) to the mature pre-fertilization ovule (stage 3-VI). The atlas provides information about the number of cells, their tissue classification, and about characteristics of cellular morphology, such as cell size and shape, for nearly all cells of the ovule. The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

        "description": "Primary cilia are essential signaling organelles that protrude from most cells in the body. Heterodimeric kinesin-2 (KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3) powers several intracellular transport processes, including intraflagellar transport (IFT), essential for ciliogenesis. A long-standing question is how a motor protein is differentially regulated for specific cargos. Since phosphorylation of the KIF3A tail domain was suggested to regulate the activity of kinesin-2 for ciliogenesis, similarly as for the cytosolic cargo N-Cadherin, we set out to map the phosphosites involved in this regulation. Using well-characterized Kif3a-/-; Kif3b-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we perform ciliogenesis rescue assays with a library of phosphomimetic mutants comprising all predicted phosphosites in the KIF3A tail domain. In contrast to previous reports, we find that KIF3A tail domain phosphorylation is dispensable for ciliogenesis in mammals. Thus, mammalian kinesin-2 is differently regulated for IFT than currently thought, consistent with the idea of differential regulation for ciliary and cytosolic cargo.",

Only cells that expressed the exogenous motor protein (KIF3A/KIF3B) from low to medium levels were selected for quantification, similarly as done previously (Engelke et al., 2019). Transfected cells were selected either in the red (KIF3B) channel, if present, or in the green (KIF3A) channel and the presence of a cilium was evaluated in the infrared (ARL13B) channel. Cilium length was manually measured, and only cilia longer than 0.5 \u00b5M were counted as cilia. In the TIF images deposited with this dataset, all cells included in the analysis are non-destructively annotated. In cells with a cilium, the cilium is traced with a numbered line (ROI), and cells without a cilium are marked by a numbered circle."

        "description": "The functional importance of nuclear protein condensation remains often unclear. The bHLH FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) controls iron acquisition and growth in plants. Previously described C-terminal serine residues allow FIT to interact and form active transcription factor complexes with subgroup Ib bHLH factors such as bHLH039. FIT has lower nuclear mobility than mutant FITmSS271AA. Here, we show that FIT undergoes a light-inducible subnuclear partitioning into FIT nuclear bodies (NBs). Using quantitative and qualitative microscopy-based approaches, we characterized FIT NBs as condensates that were reversible and likely formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. FIT accumulated preferentially in NBs versus nucleoplasm when engaged in protein complexes with itself and with bHLH039. FITmSS271AA, instead, localized to NBs with different dynamics. FIT colocalized with splicing and light signaling NB markers. The NB-inducing light conditions were linked with active FIT and elevated FIT target gene expression in roots. FIT condensation may affect nuclear mobility and be relevant for integrating environmental and Fe nutrition signals.",

Z-stacks were exported from the ZEN lite (Zeiss) software as TIFF (no compression, all dimensions) first. In ImageJ, Z-stacks were converted to RGB and 8-bit. Correct scale was set (in \u00b5m) under \u2018Properties\u2019. Parameters that should be quantified were selected under \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u2018Set 3D Measurements\u2019. To perform the analysis, \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u20183D object counter\u2019 was selected. Threshold for the intensity limit (areas below that limit were not considered for quantification) was set manually for every z-stack. Calculated values were further processed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Only size between 0,01-15 \u00b5m\u00b3 was considered. The reason for preferring manual versus automatic image adjustments is as follows: FIT NBs were numerous with varying size and signal intensity. We had found that a fixed threshold for intensity within the ImageJ software caused a loss of NBs when present but below the set threshold. To avoid this, manual inspection was preferred when using the ImageJ software to segment correctly."

For all channels, we provide cell-level datasets including sensory cortical areas on cellular level (0.54 x 0.54 x 4\u00b5m XYZ). The data provide insight into cell distribution, cell densities and fibre directions in the neocortex.\n",

Image data were acquired in a 2x3 stack mosaic acquisition, including primary auditory and primary visual cortex and surrounding areas. Light sheet NA was set to 0.165 (minimum sheet thickness 3.4\u00b5m), with a sheet width of 40% (~1.2cm) and an exposure time of 97 ms. Laser power for the respective lasers were set to 7.5mW (488nm), 22.5mW (555nm), 3.25mW (640nm), 75mW (785nm). To minimize a potential bias from the optical system, all samples but one were scanned with light sheets from the right side. \n",

        "description": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a prevalent neurological disorder that imposes a significant burden on children, families, and society worldwide. Recently, the RhoB p.S73F mutation was identified as a de novo mutation associated with CP. However, the mechanism by which the RhoB p.S73F mutation causes CP is currently unclear. In this study, rabbit models were generated to mimic the human RhoB p.S73F mutation using the SpG-BE4max system, and exhibited the typical symptoms of human CP, such as periventricular leukomalacia and spastic-dystonic diplegia. Further investigation revealed that the RhoB p.S73F mutation could activate ACAT1 through the LYN pathway, and the subsequently altered lipid levels may lead to neuronal and white matter damage resulting in the development of CP. This study presented the first mammalian model of genetic CP that accurately replicates RhoB p.S73F mutation in humans, provided further insights between RhoB and lipid metabolism, and novel therapeutic targets for human CP.",

        "description": "Long considered an accessory tubule of the male reproductive system, the epididymis is proving to be a key determinant of male fertility. In addition to its secretory role in ensuring functional maturation and survival of spermatozoa, the epididymis has a complex immune function. Indeed, it must manage both peripheral tolerance to sperm antigens foreign to the immune system and the protection of spermatozoa as well as the organ itself against pathogens ascending the epididymal tubule. Although our knowledge of the immunobiology of this organ is beginning to accumulate at the molecular and cellular levels, the organization of blood and lymphatic networks of this tissue, important players in the immune response, remains largely unknown. In the present report, we have taken advantage of a VEGFR3:YFP transgenic mouse model. Using high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging and organ clearing coupled with multiplex immunodetections of lymphatic (LYVE1, PDPN, PROX1) and/or blood (PLVAP/Meca32) markers, we provide for the first time  a simultaneous deep 3D view of the lymphatic and blood epididymal vasculature in the mature adult mouse as well as during postnatal development.",

        "description": "Bacteria encounter polymeric nutrient sources that need to be processed to support growth. Bacillus subtilis is a bacterium known for its adaptability and resilience within the rhizosphere and broader soil environment. Here we explore the role that a suite of extracellular proteases plays in supporting growth of B. subtilis when an extracellular heterologous protein (BSA) provides an abundant, but polymeric, food source. We confirm the essential role of extracellular proteases in this context and note the influence of the polymeric nutrient concentration on the yield of growth, but not on the relative level of extracellular proteases. We demonstrate the collective action of the extracellular proteases in supporting B. subtilis growth and evidence their use as a shared public good. Furthermore, we show that B. subtilis is subjected to a public good dilemma, but only in the context of using a polymeric food source. Using mathematical simulations, we uncover that this dilemma is driven by the relative cost of producing the public good. Collectively, our findings reveal how B. subtilis can survive in environments that vary significantly in terms of immediate nutrient accessibility. This information should inform steps to improve its efficacy as a biofertilizer in agricultural settings.",

        "description": "Molecular subtyping of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) has been performed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level. However, LUSC stratification based on tissue metabolomics is still lacking. Combining high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry with consensus clustering, four tumor- and four stroma-specific subtypes with distinct metabolite patterns were identified in 330 LUSC patients. The first tumor subtype T1 negatively correlated with DNA damage and immunological features including CD3, CD8, and PD-L1. The same features positively correlated with the tumor subtype T2. Tumor subtype T4 was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Compared with the status of subtypes T1 and T4, patients with subtype T3 had improved prognosis, and T3 was an independent prognostic factor with regard to UICC stage. Similarly, stroma subtypes were linked to distinct immunological features and metabolic pathways. Stroma subtype S4 had a better prognosis than S2. Subsequently, analyses based on an independent LUSC cohort treated by neoadjuvant therapy revealed that the S2 stroma subtype was associated with chemotherapy resistance. Clinically relevant patient subtypes as determined by tissue-based spatial metabolomics are a valuable addition to existing molecular classification systems. Metabolic differences among the subtypes and their associations with immunological features may contribute to the improvement of personalized therapy.",

Fixation, permeabilization, hybridization and automated fluorescence microscopy imaging were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Molecular preparation of human brain (beta), Molecular coloring, workflow setup) except for a few adaptations indicated below. Briefly, slides were thawed at room temperature and dried at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, the MC observation chamber was assembled by attaching sticky wells (8-well) to the MC slide. Sections were fixed, permeabilized, rehydrated and treated with TrueBlack (Biotium) autofluorescence quencher. In contrast to the MC protocol provided by Resolve Biosciences, we diluted the quencher 1:20 as specified by Biotium. Next, the sections were thoroughly washed and primed before the specific probes against our genes of interest were hybridized at 37\u00b0C overnight. The probe sequences were designed by Resolve Biosciences\u2019 proprietary algorithm and are hence not listed here. After hybridization, the sections were washed, and the MC observation chamber was transferred to the MC machine for eight automated iterations of coloring and imaging to decipher the transcript localization of the 100 different genes of interest in the tissue. Therefore, regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for each section (MB263, MB266, MB295, MB299) based on a brightfield overview scan. In the last imaging round, Nuclei were stained with DAPI yielding a reference image for nuclei segmentation. After the run, the MC software performs registration of the raw images, assigns transcripts to the combinatorial color codes detected and combines individual tiles to ROI panoramas. The outputs are text files containing the transcript coordinates in 3D as well as maximum projections of DAPI images for each ROI. In the images, each pixel has a width and height of 138 nm (x- and y-axis in 2-dimensional space)",

        "description": "A novel automated imaging-based method to detect inhibition of angiogenesis in early life stage zebrafish. Video subtraction was used to identify the location and number of functional intersegmental vessels according to the detection of moving blood cells. By exposing embryos to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors including SU4312, SU5416, Sorafenib, or PTK787, we confirmed that this method can detect concentration-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis. The new test method showed higher sensitivity, i.e. lower effect concentrations, relative to a fluorescent reporter gene strain (Tg(KDR:EGFP)) exposed to the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Indicating that functional effects due to altered tubulogenesis or blood transport can be detected before structural changes of the endothelium are visible by fluorescence imaging. Comparison of exposure windows indicated higher specificity for angiogenesis when exposure started at later embryonic stages (24 hours post fertilization). Our findings establish video imaging in wild-type strains as viable, non-invasive, high-throughput method for the detection of chemical-induced angiogenic disruption in zebrafish embryos. We established a lable-free and non-invasive method to visualize the blood vessel network in the developing wild type zebrafish embryo. We quantified ISV inhibition by comparing WT control, treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (SU4312, SU5416, Sorafenib and PTK787) and a fluorescent strain (TG(KDR:EGFP)). Dose-response curves and EC50 values were determined by KNIME-Workflows",

The FishInspector software allows to automatically annotate morphological features including body contour, eye, lower mouth tip, pericard, otoliths, notochord, swimbladder, and yolk and to calculate diverse metrics such as feature length, size, curvature indices, or angle between feature-connecting lines. In contrast to the previously published version, FishInspector 1.70 detects morphological features based on a deep learning approach using the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox and Matlab Image Processing Toolbox (Mathworks, Natick, MS). In addition, metric calculation were included into the software, and meta information such as test compound, exposure window or test concentration was associated to each image using a microplate layout file. To facilitate training of the models, two additional programs were generated in Matlab including FishTrainer 0.9 (for training of semantic segmentation models of structural features) and FishClassificator 0.9 (for training of position classes to be used in automated flipping of images). For image training, image size was adjusted to 450 x 300 pixel to reduce computing time. This resolution was sufficient to detect the selected features (data not shown). For training of the deep learning models, approximately 3000 previously annotated images (Teixid\u00f3 et al. 2022) were used. The automated annotations were corrected by the user in the event that they were not adequately detecting visible structures. User-bias was avoided by a blinded assessment of images. Following model training, experimental images used for annotation had a resolution of 1024 x 190 pixels\n\nFishInspector provided a JSON file corresponding to each image file containing the coordinates of all features and the applied smoothing factor. For each image, a csv file was generated containing calculated metrics. The software automatically provides a summary table containing metrics r of individual embryos. All experimental images and corresponding csv files can be found in Supplementary Material. All subsequent analyses were conducted using the summary excel file and a KNIME workflows with embedded R-scripts, as previously described (Teixid\u00f3 et al. 2022). The KNIME workflow (all workflows are available via https://git.ufz.de/automated-fish-embryotest/zebrafish-embryo-crc/zebrafish-isv) will be provided after publication) converted pixel metrics into \u00b5m or \u00b5m\u00b2, combined results from different replicates, and conducted concentration response analysis to calculate effect concentrations (EC10 and EC50).

TFish were fed twice daily with dry food (SDS-400, Special Diets Services, Essex England) and once daily with Artemia sp. Fish were cultured under 14h light/10h dark photoperiod in 20 L aquaria with 1-2 fish per liter density (26.5\u00b11 \u00b0C). Water quality parameters were pH 7\u20138; water hardness 2\u20133 mmol/L, conductivity 540\u2013560 S/cm, nitrate < 2.5 mg/L, nitrite < 0.025 mg/L, ammonia < 0.6 mg/L, oxygen saturation 87\u201391 %. Spawning trays were inserted 4-6 hours before the end of the light cycle. The following day, spawning was initiated by the onset of light and eggs were collected within 1 h. Exposure in all experiment was ceased at 96 hpf. Facilities for breeding and the production of embryos were licensed by Landesdirektion Leipzig (Aktenzeichen 75-9185.64).\nFertilized and normally developed embryos were selected according to Kimmel et al. (Kimmel et al. 1995) with a dissection microscope (Olympus SZx7-ILLT) at 1 hpf. Depending on experiment, exposure was started within 2-3 h post fertilization (16 to 128 cell stages) or at 24 hpf. Exposure was conducted in rectangular 96-well microplates (Clear Polystyrene, flat bottom, Uniplate, Whatman, GE Healthcare) covered by a lid with a test volume of 400 \u00b5L of exposure media. For each replicate one embryo per well and 16 wells per concentration were assessed. Experiments were performed with at least two replicates on independent days and breeding.\n"

        "release_date": "2023-12-15",
        "description": "In 2015, we launched the mesoSPIM initiative (www.mesospim.org), an open-source project for making light-sheet microscopy of large cleared tissues more accessible. Meanwhile, the demand for imaging larger samples at higher speed and resolution has increased, requiring major improvements in the capabilities of light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce the next-generation mesoSPIM (\"Benchtop\") with significantly increased field of view, improved resolution, higher throughput, more affordable cost and simpler assembly compared to the original version. We developed a new method for testing objectives, enabling us to select detection objectives optimal for light-sheet imaging with large-sensor sCMOS cameras. The new mesoSPIM achieves high spatial resolution (1.5 \u00b5m laterally, 3.3 \u00b5m axially) across the entire field of view, a magnification up to 20x, and supports sample sizes ranging from sub-mm up to several centimetres, while being compatible with multiple clearing techniques. The new microscope serves a broad range of applications in neuroscience, developmental biology, and even physics.",

        "description": "The heterodimeric kinesin-2 motor (KIF3A/KIF3B with accessory protein KAP3) drives intraflagellar transport, essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary function. Three point mutations in the KIF3B subunit have recently been linked to disease in humans (E250Q and L523P) and Bengal cats (A334T) (Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2020). Patients display retinal atrophy and, in some cases, other ciliopathy phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism leading to disease is currently unknown. Here, we used Kif3a-/-;Kif3b-/- (knockout) 3T3 cells, which cannot make cilia, to characterize these mutations. While reexpression of KIF3B(E250Q) and KIF3B(L523P) did not rescue ciliogenesis, reexpression of wildtype or KIF3B(A334T), restored ciliogenesis to wildtype levels. Fluorescent tagging revealed that the E250Q mutant decorated microtubules and thus is a rigor mutation. The L523P mutation, in the alpha-helical stalk domain, surprisingly did not affect formation of the KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3 complex but instead impaired motility along microtubules. Lastly, expression of the A334T motor was reduced in comparison to all other conditions and displayed an impaired ability to disperse the Golgi complex when artificially linked to this high-load cargo. In summary, this work uses cell-based assays to elucidates the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations in the KIF3B subunit on the kinesin-2 holoenzyme.",

        "description": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an encephalitic bunyavirus that can infect neurons in the brain. There are no approved therapeutics that can protect from RVFV encephalitis. Innate immunity, the first line of defense against infection, canonically antagonizes viruses through interferon signaling. We found that interferons did not efficiently protect primary cortical neurons from RVFV, unlike other cell types. To identify alternative neuronal antiviral pathways, we screened innate immune ligands and discovered that the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 inhibited RVFV infection, and other bunyaviruses. Mechanistically, we found that Pam3CSK4 blocks viral fusion, independent of TLR2. In a mouse model of RVFV encephalitis, Pam3CSK4 treatment protected animals from infection and mortality. Overall, Pam3CSK4 is a bunyavirus fusion inhibitor active in primary neurons and the brain, representing a new approach toward the development of treatments for encephalitic bunyavirus infections.",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0012.  Genetic screens for phenotypic similarity have made key contributions to associating genes with biological processes. With RNA interference (RNAi), highly parallel phenotyping of loss-of-function effects in cells has become feasible. One of the current challenges however is the computational categorization of visual phenotypes and the prediction of biological function and processes. In this study, we describe a combined computational and experimental approach to discover novel gene functions and explore functional relationships. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in human cells and used quantitative descriptors derived from high-throughput imaging to generate multiparametric phenotypic profiles. We show that profiles predicted functions of genes by phenotypic similarity. Specifically, we examined several candidates including the largely uncharacterized gene DONSON, which shared phenotype similarity with known factors of DNA damage response (DDR) and genomic integrity. Experimental evidence supports that DONSON is a novel centrosomal protein required for DDR signalling and genomic integrity. Multiparametric phenotyping by automated imaging and computational annotation is a powerful method for functional discovery and mapping the landscape of phenotypic responses to cellular perturbations.",

First, nuclei were segmented by adaptive thresholding of the DNA channel, distance map computation and watershed segmentation. Next, nuclei were regularized by morphological opening, and internal holes were removed by inverse flood fill (see Supplementary information). Cell boundaries were identified by Voronoi segmentation (Jones et al, 2009). Each cell was characterized by a set of 51 morphological descriptors, computed on different channels, which were grouped into 4 categories: 9 geometric features, 26 Haralick textural features, 11 Zernike moments and 5 miscellaneous features (see Supplementary information). All descriptors are translation and rotation invariant and are commonly used in cell imaging for classification purposes (Loo et al, 2007). Cells were classified into 1 of 10 classes (Supplementary Table II), using the 'one_against_one' multi_class strategy of the SVM algorithm, with a training set of 2545 manually annotated cells (Supplementary Tables III, IV, V and VI). Each well subject to siRNA perturbation was summarized by a vector of 13 numerical descriptors (Supplementary Table VII). Each value of a phenotypic profile was transformed to a [0,1] score using a set of parameterized monotonic functions, leading to a vector of 19 scores, which we termed a phenoprint. A phenoprint was considered a hit if at least one of its elements was larger than 0.5. The phenotypic distance between two perturbations was defined as the distance between two phenoprints, according to a modified L1 metric (see Supplementary information)."

        "release_date": "2023-09-07",
        "description": "The peptide toxin candidalysin, secreted by Candida albicans hyphae promotes, the stimulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), while candidalysin alone triggers a distinct mechanism for NET-like structures (NLS), which are more compact and less fibrous than canonical NETs. Candidalysin activates NADPH oxidase and calcium influx, with both processes contributing to morphological changes in neutrophils resulting in NLS formation. NLS are induced by leukotoxic hypercitrullination, which is governed by calcium-induced protein arginine deaminase 4 activation and initiation of intracellular signalling events in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, activation of signalling by candidalysin does not suffice to trigger downstream events essential for NET formation, as demonstrated by lack of lamin A/C phosphorylation, an event required for activation of cyclin-dependent kinases that are crucial for NET release. Candidalysin-triggered NLS demonstrate anti-Candida activity, which is resistant to nuclease treatment and dependent on the deprivation of Zn2+. This study reveals that C. albicans hyphae releasing candidalysin concurrently trigger canonical NETs and NLS, which together form a fibrous sticky network that entangles C. albicans hyphae and efficiently inhibits their growth.",

        "description": "Neurophysiology and neuropathology are mediated by the interaction of neurons and glial cells, which cannot be modelled by monocultures. However, mixed cultures are difficult to use and analyse for high-throughput screening. Here, we show the utility of compound and target screening using primary neuron-glia cultures to model inflammatory neurodegeneration alongside live-cell stains and automated classification of neurons, astrocytes or microglia using open-source analysis software. Out of 227 compounds with known bioactivities, 29 protected against lipopolysaccharide-induced neuronal loss, including drugs affecting adrenergic, steroid, inflammatory and MAP kinase signalling. The screen also identified physiological compounds, such as noradrenaline and progesterone, that protected, and identified neurotoxic compounds, such as a TLR7 agonist, that induced microglial proliferation. Thus, combining automated image analysis of complex cultures with high-throughput screening of known compounds in a cellular model of disease allows identification of important biology, as well as potential targets and drugs for treatment.",

Background subtraction was omitted owing to the uniformity of image illumination achieved on the high-content imager, which helped reduce computation time. A Cellpose module was used for segmentation of nuclei (Hoechst), and the resulting objects were shrunk by 1px to more accurately mask the nuclear area. Intensity and shape measurements were derived for each objects. The pipeline saves object images suitable for reloading into CellProfiler for further analysis, which avoids the need to rerun the computationally costly Cellpose segmentation again. Object outline images are also saved, which can be loaded into CellProfiler Analyst (CPA) alongside the original images for clear visualisation of objects (and mis-segmentation events) during classifier training. Object measurements were stored in an SQLite database, which was handled using the freely available DB Browser for SQLite software (https://sqlitebrowser.org/). \n\nA randomly selected subset of the final object set from each repeat was then loaded into CPA (this reduced the tile fetch times while fetching objects for classification in CPA), and randomly selected objects from this set were classified manually into 7 classes, aiming for 400 objects each: Neuron, Microglia, Astrocyte, Other, Condensed, Necrotic or Debris. Once all four repeats were completed, object sets and training sets were combined, resulting in 1,600 total objects annotated per class and spread evenly across repeats such that the final classifier should be robust to any variation in cells, staining, or image quality over the entire screen (11,274 objects in total). The training set was therefore balanced across the 4 biological repeats, and otherwise was randomly sampled such that there should be roughly equal representation of cells from LPS- and LPS+ wells (and roughly equal contribution from each compound treatment as well)\n\nAccording to internal accuracy validation (k-fold validation), a Random Trees Classifier performed the best, and this was used for final analysis (validation data can be found in the publication)\n\nCellProfiler version was 4.2.4 (built from source). CellProfiler Analyst version was 3.0\n"

        "description": "In Drosophila male gonads, niche-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has a role in maintaining stem cells in close proximity but the range of Dpp diffusion and its role has never been tested in the differentiating cells spaced one-cell layer away. Here, using genetically encoded nanobodies called Morphotraps, we physically block Dpp diffusion without interfering with niche-stem cell signaling and find that a diffusible fraction of Dpp is required to ensure differentiation of GSC daughter cells, opposite of its role in maintenance of GSC in the niche. Our work provides an example in which a soluble niche ligand induces opposed cellular responses in stem cells versus differentiating descendants to ensure spatial control of the niche, which may be a common mechanism to regulate tissue homeostasis.",

        "release_date": "2024-01-22",
        "description": "Diabetes is caused by the inability of electrically coupled, functionally heterogeneous \u03b2-cells within the pancreatic islet to provide adequate insulin secretion. Functional networks have been used to represent synchronized oscillatory [Ca2+] dynamics and to study \u03b2-cell subpopulations, which play an important role in driving islet function. The mechanism by which highly synchronized \u03b2-cell subpopulations drive islet function is unclear. We used experimental and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between functional networks, structural (gap-junction) networks, and intrinsic \u03b2-cell dynamics in slow and fast oscillating islets. Highly synchronized subpopulations in the functional network were differentiated by intrinsic dynamics, including metabolic activity and KATP channel conductance, more than structural coupling. Consistent with this, intrinsic dynamics were more predictive of high synchronization in the islet functional network as compared to high levels of structural coupling. Finally, dysfunction of gap junctions, which can occur in diabetes, caused decreases in the efficiency and clustering of the functional network. These results indicate that intrinsic dynamics rather than structure drive connections in the functional network and highly synchronized subpopulations, but gap junctions are still essential for overall network efficiency. These findings deepen our interpretation of functional networks and the formation of functional sub-populations in dynamic tissues such as the islet.\u2003",

        "release_date": "2024-04-11",
        "description": "Multiple myeloma involves early dissemination of malignant plasma cells across the bone marrow; however, the initial steps of dissemination remain unclear. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) stimulate myeloma cell expansion (e.g., IL-6) and simultaneously retain myeloma cells via chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) and adhesion factors. Hence, we hypothesized that the imbalance between cell division and retention drives dissemination. \nWe present an in vitro model using primary hMSCs co-cultured with INA-6 myeloma cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed proliferation and attachment/detachment dynamics. Separation techniques (V-well adhesion assay and well plate sandwich centrifugation) were established to isolate MSC-interacting myeloma subpopulations that were characterized by RNAseq, cell viability and apoptosis. Results were correlated with gene expression data (n=837) and survival of myeloma patients (n=536). \nOn dispersed hMSCs, INA-6 saturate hMSC-surface before proliferating into large homotypic aggregates, from which single cells detached completely. On confluent hMSCs, aggregates were replaced by strong heterotypic hMSC-INA-6 interactions, which modulated apoptosis time-dependently. Only INA-6 daughter cells (nMA-INA6) detached from hMSCs by cell division but sustained adherence to hMSC-adhering mother cells (MA-INA6).\nIsolated nMA-INA6 indicated hMSC-autonomy through superior viability after IL\u00ad6 withdrawal and upregulation of proliferation-related genes. MA-INA6 upregulated adhesion and retention factors (CXCL12), that, intriguingly, were highly expressed in myeloma samples from patients with longer overall and progression-free survival, but their expression decreased in relapsed myeloma samples. \nAltogether, in vitro dissemination of INA-6 is driven by detaching daughter cells after a cycle of hMSC-(re)attachment and proliferation, involving adhesion factors that represent a bone marrow-retentive phenotype with potential clinical relevance.",

Two new subpopulations become evident from time-lapse acquisitions: MSC-adhering INA-6 cells (MA-INA6) and non-MSC-adhering INA-6 (nMA-INA6). MA-INA6 remain adherent on both dispersed and confluent hMSCs, their cell division gives rise to one nMA-INA6 cell that can re-adhere to the hMSCs.

Three fluorescence channels encode a nuclear marker for segmentation and tracking, and reporters for CDK2 and ERK activity. \n\nData dimensions: [t,c,z,y,x] -> [145, 3, 188, 188, 188]\nData format: zarr, \nVoxel size: 0.29x0.29x0.29 \u03bcm/px\nTime resolution: 5min/frame\n\nChannels:\nC0: ERK-KTR-mTurquoise2 (ERK activity)\nC1: DHB-mRuby2 (CDK2 activity)\nC2: H2B-miRFP703 (nuclear marker)\n\nThe dataset is used in the paper accompanying conv-paint, an interactive image segmentation tool for napari. The paper will be linked as soon as a preprint is published. The dataset is an interesting test set for various image analysis tools, especially because of its high dimensionality. Stored as a zarr array, it can be drag-and-dropped into the image viewer napari for interactive visualisation and exploration. Each chunk represents one time point.",

        "description": "Accumulation of abnormal tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Accurate and efficient detection and quantification of NFTs in tissue samples aids in deeper phenotyping of Alzheimer disease and may reveal relationships with clinical, demographic, and genetic features. However, expert manual analysis can be time-consuming, subject to observer variability, and limited in handling the large amounts of data generated by modern imaging techniques. We present a scalable, open access, deep learning-based approach to quantify the NFT burden in digital whole slide images (WSIs) of post-mortem human brain tissue. We trained a UNet model on 45 annotated 2400\u00b5m by 1200\u00b5m regions of interest (ROIs) selected from 15 unique WSIs of temporal cortex from Alzheimer disease cases from three institutes (University of California (UC)-Davis, UC-San Diego, and Columbia University). We developed a method to generate detailed segmentation ground truth masks at the pixel level directly from simple point annotations. The model achieved a precision of 0.53, recall of 0.60, and F1 score of 0.53 on a held-out test set of 7 WSIs, providing researchers with an efficient and reliable tool for NFT burden quantification. We compared this to an object detection model on the same dataset, which achieved comparable but more coarse-grained performance. Both models correlated with expert semi-quantitative scores at the whole-slide level. Our approach provides an open deep learning pipeline for detailed and scalable NFT spatial distribution and morphology analysis across large cohorts, which is not feasible through manual assessment.\n\nThe dataset includes all WSIs and annotations used in the study.",

The SELMA3D challenge focuses on self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation. Its objective is to encourage the development of self-supervised learning methods for general segmentation of various structures in 3D light-sheet microscopy images. The dataset contains 3D whole-brain microscopy image of different labeled biological structures, including blood vessels, c-Fos labeled brain cells involved in neural activity, cell nuclei, and Alzheimer's disease plaques.

This raises the question whether ASC is involved in additional aggregation proteinopathies. In this study we report that ASC governs the extent of inflammation-induced amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, a systemic disease caused by the aggregation and peripheral deposition of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA).",

        "release_date": "2024-07-04",
        "description": "This dataset contains the fluorescence microscopy image data underlying the study \"Suppression of bacterial cell death underlies the antagonistic interaction between ciprofloxacin and tetracycline in Escherichia coli\" published as a preprint in BioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.18.590101). \n\nThe images were captured using Escherichia coli cells trapped in a mother machine microfluidic device (methods also described here https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202110441).\nThe aim of these experiments was to evaluate the single-cell physiological response of E coli to exposure to ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TET) combinations using different growth media.\n\nThe data  is divided into \"Compiled_output_data\" and the specific \"Figure\" folders (Figure-1, Figure-2, Figure-3), which contains the image files and data outputs for each experiment separately.  \n\n#Compiled_output_data\": \nContains the compiled output data from the fluorescence microscopy experiments as described above in both CSV and pickle format. This folder contais a specific README file (README-compiled) with instructions on how to open the compiled data file using the pickle function in Python.\n\n# Figure-1.zip, Figure-2.zip, Figure-3.zip: \nWithin each main figure data folder, we separated the datasets into two subfolders: \"Fluorescence_microscopy_images\" and \"BACMMAN_outputs\". Within each of these folders the data is then divided and named according to the specific figure panels where they first appear and the treatment used (e.g., \"1BFI-Glu-aa-control\"). \nDifferent replicates are shown in the next directory level as for example: \"Gluaa-control-1\" and \"Gluaa-control-2\". \n\n -\"Fluorescence_microscopy_images\": contains the raw image data (TIFF format); \n - \"BACMMAN_outputs\" contains: \"Output\" folder which has segmented and pre-processed image files from BACMMAN (TIFF and .db formats), the configuration files used in BACMMAN to perform the segmentation and the measurements  (files named with suffix \"BACMMAN_config\"; JSON format), and the data output files containing the quantification results obtained from the images for mKate2 (detected using mCherry filter) and GFP channels [gene expression reporters for SOS expression PsulA-mGFP) and constitutive expression (Ptet01-mKate2)]. The files are named with the suffix \"Output_data-GFP\" and \"Output_data-mKate2\"; CSV format). \n\nThe same source data that was used in Figs.1-2-3 were also used to produce other analysis, and therefore are related to several other figures in the manuscript.

                        "features_analysed": "Cell segmentation and lineage tracking were performed using BACMMAN run in Fiji (Ollion et al.,2019). The BACMMAN configuration was adapted to segment and track cells based on fluorescence images. Images (tiff format) were imported in BACMMAN and pre-processed prior to segmentation. This included image rotation to ensure channels were vertically oriented and the channel opening was at the bottom, and cropping of images to include only the area consisting of microchannels. Background subtraction was performed for both fluorescent channels using ImageJ\u2019s subtract background algorithm (rolling ball method, radius=8). Joint segmentation and tracking of cells were performed using a DistNet model trained on our datasets. DistNet is based on a deep neural network (Ollion and Ollion, 2020). Segmentation was performed on the mKate fluorescence channel. Segmentation parameters were optimised for each dataset. Curation of segmentation and tracking was carried out using BACMMAN\u2019s interactive graphical interface. Although automated segmentation and tracking was mostly accurate, occasionally errors were produced. Thus, almost every lineage was manually checked, with CIP exposure datasets requiring the most curation mainly due to excessive elongation of cells. At this point obvious irregularities were removed including mother cells that did not grow for the duration of the experiment and those that were already excessively elongated at the beginning of the experiment. Positions with channel deformities and where loss of focus occurred were also discarded. Single-cell fluorescent intensities were calculated by dividing the sum of pixel intensity values by the cell area. Cell length was determined as the maximal distance between two points of the cell contour (FeretMax). Elongation rates were calculated per cell-cycle (generation) by fitting an exponential function, St = S0e\u00b5t, on the estimated length of cells, where \u00b5 is the elongation rate, S0 is the length at birth, St is the length at time t. A minimum of 3 frames per generation was imposed as a fitting constraint. Division rates were calculated as the inverse of the interdivision time. The latter was determined as the time interval between two divisions. Cell fluorescence and morphology measurements were then exported from BACMMAN into csv files for further analysis. "

Filters used were purchased from Chroma. mGFP fluorescence was measured using 80 ms exposure, whereas mKate fluorescence was imaged for 100 ms, both at minimal camera gain and maximum lamp intensity. Brightfield images were also acquired at each frame using a 20 ms exposure. The microscope and temperature chamber was turned on to 37\u00b0C at least 2 hours before imaging. The microscope was controlled from MATLAB via MicroManager (Edelstein et al., 2014) using a custom-made user interface developed by Sebastian Jaramillo-Riveri (Jaramillo-Riveri, 2019).

        "title": "The FMRF-NH2 Gated Sodium Channel of Biomphalaria glabrata: Localization and Expression Following Infection by Schistosoma mansoni",
        "release_date": "2023-04-03",
        "description": "The neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis impacts over 700 million people globally. Schistosoma mansoni, the trematode parasite that causes the most common type of schistosomiasis, requires planorbid pond snails of the genus Biomphalaria to support its larval development and transformation to the cercarial form that can infect humans.  A greater understanding of neural signaling systems that are specific to the Biomphalaria intermediate host could lead to novel strategies for parasite or snail control.  This study examined a Biomphalaria glabrata neural channel that is gated by the neuropeptide FMRF-NH2. The Biomphalaria glabrata FMRF-NH2 gated sodium channel (Bgl-FaNaC) amino acid sequence was highly conserved with FaNaCs found in related gastropods, especially the planorbid Planorbella trivolvis (91% sequence identity). In common with the P. trivolvis FaNaC, the B. glabrata channel exhibited a low affinity (EC50: 3 x 10-4 M) and high specificity for the FMRF-NH2 agonist. Its expression in the central nervous system, detected with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, was widespread, with the protein localized mainly to neuronal fibers and the mRNA confined to cell bodies. Colocalization of the Bgl-FaNaC message with its FMRF-NH2 agonist precursor occurred in some neurons associated with male mating behavior.  At the mRNA level, Bgl-FaNaC expression was decreased at 20 and 35 days post infection (dpi) by S. mansoni.  Increased expression of the transcript encoding the FMRF-NH2 agonist at 35 dpi was proposed to reflect a compensatory response to decreased receptor levels. Altered FMRF-NH2 signaling could be vital for parasite proliferation in its intermediate host and may therefore present innovative opportunities for snail control. ",

        "description": "3D cell cultures are indispensable in recapitulating in vivo environments. Among the many 3D culture methods, culturing adherent cells on hydrogel beads to form spheroid-like structures is a powerful strategy for maintaining high cell viability and functions in the adherent states. However, high-throughput, scalable technologies for 3D imaging of individual cells cultured on the hydrogel scaffolds are lacking. This study reports the development of a high throughput, scalable 3D imaging flow cytometry platform for analyzing spheroid models. This platform is realized by integrating a single objective fluorescence light-sheet microscopy with a microfluidic device that combines hydrodynamic and acoustofluidic focusing techniques. This integration enabled unprecedentedly high-throughput and scalable optofluidic 3D imaging, processing 1310 spheroids consisting of 28 117 cells per minute. The large dataset obtained enables precise quantification and comparison of the nuclear morphology of adhering and suspended cells, revealing that the adhering cells have smaller nuclei with less rounded surfaces. This platform's high throughput, robustness, and precision for analyzing the morphology of subcellular structures in 3D culture models hold promising potential for various biomedical analyses, including image-based phenotypic screening of drugs with spheroids or organoids.",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0025.  We have developed a platform for validation of antibody binding and protein subcellular localization data obtained from immunofluorescence using siRNA technology combined with automated confocal microscopy and image analysis. By combining the siRNA technology with automated sample preparation, automated imaging and quantitative image analysis, a high-throughput assay has been set-up to enable confirmation of accurate protein binding and localization in a systematic manner. Here, we describe the analysis and validation of the subcellular location of 65 human proteins, targeted by 75 antibodies and silenced by 130 siRNAs. A large fraction of (80%) the subcellular locations, including locations of several previously uncharacterized proteins, could be confirmed by the significant down-regulation of the antibody signal after the siRNA silencing. A quantitative analysis was set-up using automated image analysis to facilitate studies of targets found in more than one compartment. The results obtained using the platform demonstrate that siRNA silencing in combination with quantitative image analysis of antibody signals in different compartments of the cells is an attractive approach for ensuring accurate protein localization as well as antibody binding using immunofluorescence. With a large fraction of the human proteome still unexplored, we suggest this approach to be of great importance under the continued work of mapping the human proteome on a subcellular level.",

To prevent misleading results caused by background staining, segmentation masks using the fluorescent staining of the cells, nuclei and cytoplasm, was applied prior to quantitative fluorescence measurements (Fig. 1). The segmentation module was set-up using the predefined algorithms available within Cell profiler [21] using the DAPI staining for identification of primary objects (the nuclei), with a size threshold of 30-100 and 150-400 pixels in diameter for 10x and 40x images respectively. Secondary objects were identified around the primary objects using the microtubule staining and a propagation algorithm to define cell borders. The overlay of the nucleusand cell mask was used to generate the cytoplasm mask. The in-build Otsu global algorithm was used to set intensity cut-offs for primary as well as secondary objects. The quantitative analysis was performed within different segmented objects depending on the complexity of the antibody staining. For antibodies staining a single organelle, analysis was done within the entire cell only, whereas independent quantification of the fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm was performed for antibodies staining multiple organelles, to compare decreases in the compartments separately an thus be able to explore potential cross reactivity. For each object, the integrated fluorescence intensity (IFI) from the HPA antibody was measured and normalized to the IFI of the common microtubule antibody to enable comparison between different samples. The median integrated fluorescence intensity (IFI) for each sample (siRNA and negative control) was calculated. This allowed for comparison of samples, while reducing the impact of staining artifacts and outliers on both pixel and cell level. To quantify the degree of siRNA efficacy and protein downregulation in the siRNA well, the median IFI was compared to the negative control to obtain the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) between 0 and 100% where 100% indicate no decrease and 0% indicate complete disappearance of the signal. For visualization of the results the distribution of RFI for the cells in a sample was presented in a box-plot and the significance of the down-regulation was evaluated using a Mann Whitney test. This procedure was automated by an in-house developed Laboratory Information Management System to allow rapid assessment of the results.\t"

A 10 x/0.3 N/A dry objective was used for single organelle staining antibodies and to facilitate proper annotation, higher magnification using a 40x/0.85 N/A dry objective for the multiple organelle staining antibodies. Both objectives were used with the following scanning settings; 8 bit acquisition, 600 Hz scan speed, line average 2 and a image size of 2048x2048 pixels. The pixel size was 0.75 x 0.75 um and 0.19 x 0.19 um for the 10 x and 40 x objective. To capture enough cells (n > 20) for the subsequent quantitative analysis, images were acquired at 4 or 16 non-overlapping positions in each well for the 10 x and 40 x objective, respectively. With this set-up, 48 or 192 images were acquired for each antibody. For each position, a low-resolution (16 x 16 pixels) autofocus procedure based on contrast from the microtubule antibody staining (contrast based method 1 in Leica Matrix Screener v.2.3.0) was applied using the 543 nm HeNe laser. Following this, a sequential acquisition of the three fluorophores was used to avoid cross talk with the following setup: a UV 405 nm diode laser for excitation of the DAPI staining of the nucleus, a 543 nm and 633 nm HeNe laser for excitation of the Alexa 555 and Alexa 647 secondary antibodies staining the microtubules (a-tubulin) and calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (the latter used for normal variation study only), and a 488nm argon laser exciting the Alexa 488 secondary antibody for detection of the target protein. Before starting the automated acquisition, the detector gain was manually adjusted for each antibody using the staining of the negative control. To make best use of the dynamic range of the detec-or and to trace any potential decrease in staining intensity between the wells, the gain was adjusted to minimize the number of saturated pixels and use the full dynamic range of the detector. To allow quantitative relative measurements of staining intensity, the two siRNA samples and the control were always imaged with identical gain settings. To better visualize the degree of down-regulation as a result from quantitative imaging, a selected subset of antibodies were imaged manually at higher resolution using a 63x/ 1.4 N/A oil immersion objective, with the same parameters as for the automated setup. The pixel size here was 80 x 80nm.",

        "description": "\"OME-NGFF converted study from idr0016.  Phenotypic profiling attempts to summarize multiparametric, feature-based analysis of cellular phenotypes of each sample so that similarities between profiles reflect similarities between samples. This image set provides a basis for testing image-based profiling methods wrt. to their ability to distinguish the effects of small molecules. The images are of U2OS cells treated with each of over 30,000 known bioactive compounds and labeled with six labels that characterize seven organelles (the cell-painting assay). Gustafsdottir et al. (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0080999) have developed a multiplex cytological profiling assay that \"paints the cell\" with as many fluorescent markers as possible without compromising our ability to extract rich, quantitative profiles in high throughput. The assay detects seven major cellular components. In a pilot screen of bioactive compounds, the assay detected a range of cellular phenotypes and it clustered compounds with similar annotated protein targets or chemical structure based on cytological profiles. The results demonstrate that the assay captures subtle patterns in the combination of morphological labels, thereby detecting the effects of chemical compounds even though their targets are not stained directly. This image-based assay provides an unbiased approach to characterize compound- and disease-associated cell states to support future probe discovery. Using the cell-painting assay, the Broad Institute has assembled a reference dataset of profiles for U2OS osteosarcoma cells treated with ~30,000 compounds. The compound collection includes DOS-derived compounds (20,000), as well as chemically diverse MLI compounds with biologically diverse performance identified through analysis of PubChem (10,000), and known bioactive compounds to serve as landmarks (2,500). The DOS compounds consist of structurally diverse and stereochemically rich compounds with structures distinct from the current MLSMR. The compound collection also includes 267 distinct compounds nominated by MLPCN Centers from projects for which the Centers would like to identify new chemical series with similar activities.\"",

For general image acquisition, image size was set to 4096 x 4096 pixels, with a per-pixel scaling of 0.10 \u03bcm x 0.10 \u03bcm on a Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 objective at 1X zoom. Unidirectional scan speed was set to provide a 0.68 \u03bcs pixel-dwell, and bit-depth and averaging were set to 16. Per fluorophore, the following emission wavelength cutoffs were used: NucBlue (411-450 nm), sfGFP (491-534 nm), mCherry (580-632 nm), and Alexa iFluor 647 phalloidin (640-701 nm). Pinholes were set to 1 Airy Unit (AU). To generate 3D models, a 40X variant of this method with z-stacks (10 \u03bcm of tissue; 0.33 \u03bcm slice spacing) and tiling was used. In replicating GAP studies, a Zeiss Axio Observer was also used.\n\n\tImage processing was performed in Zen Blue and Zen Black, with deconvolution of sfGFP and mCherry performed in ImageJ. Diffraction PSF 3D was used to generate PSFs, and Deconvolution Lab (Sage et al., 2017) was used to perform Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding (5 iterations, \u03b3 = 1, \u03bb = 0.1, wavelets = spline 3, and scale = 3). A bandpass Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used for size-based exclusion of lumen background. In Zen Blue, the following sequential steps and corresponding thresholds were used: Background Subtraction (150), Single Pixel Filter (1.5), Gauss (1.15), and Unsharp Mask (0.5). After Min/Max autoscaling of the histograms, this file was saved as a TIFF to have HDR applied in sampling mode with an intensity of 2 in Zen Black.\n\n\tFor RNAScope-based assays, an Airyscan (CO) protocol was developed. Image size was set to 1024 x 1024 pixels, with a per-pixel scaling of 0.07 \u03bcm x 0.07 \u03bcm on a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective at 2X zoom, with 0.02 \u03bcm x 0.02 \u03bcm per-pixel scaling and 8X zoom used for inset magnifications. Pixel dwell was set to 2.05 \u03bcs and averaging was set to 8 for acquisition of 16-bit images. Per laser line, the following pinholes were used: 405 nm (2.94 AU), 514 nm (2.21 AU), 543 nm (1 AU), and 633 nm (1 AU). Images were processed with four-component linear unmixing and bandpass FFT prior to saving as TIFF for HDR application.\n\n        For histopathological image generation and analysis (AB/PAS), Hamamatsu Photonics NDP.scan was employed for complete slide scanning. For counting goblet cells and determining crypt lengths, resulting images were analyzed with Hamamatsu Photonics NDP-view2.\n",

        "description": "Recently, a low-level somatic mutation in the NRAS gene (c.182 A > G, Q61R) was identified in various specimens from patients with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis. However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

                            "Cells were plated on thin layers of Geltrex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate, cultured in EBM2, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 h. Images were captured automatically every 5 min using time-lapse video microscopy (WSL-1800-B; ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After 20 h, microscopic images were taken and analyzed by Wimasis Image Analysis (WimTube; Wimasis GmbH Munich, Germany). Tube formation was observed by microscopy (BZ-9000; KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). To assess the association between the proportion of mutated cells and the function of tube formation, the differences in tube formation function were examined in NRAS wild type HDLECs (NRASWT) (NRASWT 100% and NRASQ61R 0%), NRASQ61R HDLECs (NRASWT 0% and NRASQ61R 100%), and mixed HDLECs (NRASWT 95% and NRASQ61R 5%, and NRASWT 25% and NRASQ61R 75%). To analyze the function of tube formation, covered area, total nets, and tube length standard deviation in each image was counted and average values within groups were compared. \u201cCovered area\u201d means the area occupied by cellular components, and \u201ctotal nets\u201d means the number of nets (a structure in which two or more loops are connected). At least three fields per well were examined, and each experimental condition was tested in triplicate. In addition, 30 ng/ml mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin (sirolimus); Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 30 ng/ml MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib; ChemScene, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) was added to these cells for examination of drug inhibition.

Briefly, CE-TOFMS and CE-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent CE capillary electrophoresis system equipped with an Agilent 6210 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Agilent 6460 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (Agilent Technologies), respectively. The systems were controlled by Agilent G2201AA ChemStation software version B.03.01 for CE (Agilent Technologies) and connected by a fused silica capillary (50 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 80 cm total length) with commercial electrophoresis buffer (H3301-1001 and I3302-1023 for cation and anion analyses, respectively, at HMT) as the electrolyte. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 50 to 1,000 (Ohashi et al., 2008)11 and the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to detect compounds in dynamic MRM mode. Peaks were extracted using MasterHands, automatic integration software (Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan) (Sugimoto et al., 2009)13 and MassHunter Quantitative Analysis B.04.00 (Agilent Technologies) to obtain peak information including m/z, peak area and migration time (MT). Signal peaks were annotated in accordance with HMT\u2019s metabolite database based on their m/z values and MTs. The peak area of each metabolite was normalized to internal standards, and metabolite concentration was evaluated by standard curves with three-point calibrations using each standard compound. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis (Yamamoto et al., 2014)14 were performed by HMT\u2019s proprietary MATLAB and R programs, respectively. Detected metabolites were plotted on metabolic pathway maps using VANTED software (Junker et al., 2006)15."

Images were captured automatically every 5 min using time-lapse video microscopy (WSL-1800-B; ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After 20 h, microscopic images were taken and analyzed by Wimasis Image Analysis (WimTube; Wimasis GmbH Munich, Germany). Tube formation was observed by microscopy (BZ-9000; KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). To assess the association between the proportion of mutated cells and the function of tube formation, the differences in tube formation function were examined in NRAS wild type HDLECs (NRASWT) (NRASWT 100% and NRASQ61R 0%), NRASQ61R HDLECs (NRASWT 0% and NRASQ61R 100%), and mixed HDLECs (NRASWT 95% and NRASQ61R 5%, and NRASWT 25% and NRASQ61R 75%). To analyze the function of tube formation, covered area, total nets, and tube length standard deviation in each image was counted and average values within groups were compared. \u201cCovered area\u201d means the area occupied by cellular components, and \u201ctotal nets\u201d means the number of nets (a structure in which two or more loops are connected). At least three fields per well were examined, and each experimental condition was tested in triplicate.

Images were captured automatically every 5 min using time-lapse video microscopy (WSL-1800-B; ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

To assess the association between the proportion of mutated cells and the function of tube formation, the differences in tube formation function were examined in NRAS wild type HDLECs (NRASWT) (NRASWT 100% and NRASQ61R 0%), NRASQ61R HDLECs (NRASWT 0% and NRASQ61R 100%), and mixed HDLECs (NRASWT 95% and NRASQ61R 5%, and NRASWT 25% and NRASQ61R 75%).

        "description": "The tight control of fate transitions during stem cell differentiation is essential for proper\ntissue development and maintenance. However, identifying how the multilayered regulation\nof gene expression programmes orchestrates stem cell differentiation in vivo remains\nelusive, because of the challenges in studying sparsely distributed adult stem cells in a\nsystematic manner. Here, we synchronised Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC)\ndifferentiation in vivo to perform in-depth transcriptome and translatome analyses at high\ndevelopmental resolution. This characterisation revealed widespread and dynamic changes\nin mRNA level, promoter usage, exon inclusion, and translation efficiency. Transient\nexpression of the master regulator, Bam, drives a first wave of expression changes, primarily\nmodifying the cell cycle programme. Surprisingly, as Bam levels recede, differentiating cells\nreturn to a remarkably stem cell-like transcription and translation programme, with a few\ncrucial changes feeding into a second phase driving terminal differentiation to form the\noocyte. Altogether, these findings reveal that rather than a unidirectional accumulation of\nchanges, the in vivo differentiation programme relies on distinctly regulated and\ndevelopmentally sequential waves.",

        "description": "Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density. ",

For the whole embryos obtained previously (47) that are used in this study, the first and last 3rd cleavage divisions occur between 0 and 2 h from each other. To compare the timing of whole embryos and doublets, we used the mean delay between cleavage divisions of whole embryos as the time after 3rd cleavage.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the contact angle of cell-cell contacts in whole embryos and doublets. Using the angle tool, the equatorial plane in which two contacting cells are observed is chosen to manually measure the external contact angle. Data of compacting whole WT embryos are taken from freely available time lapse images obtained previously (47).\nTo measure the size of contacts on doublets, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure length of contact at its equatorial plane.\nTo measure the size of micropipettes, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure the inner diameter near the tip.\n\nImmunostaining\nDoublets are imaged and synchronized using the 3rd cleavage division from 4- to 8-cell stage before being fixed and stained.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the intensity of Cdh1 and filamentous actin (phalloidin) in doublets to determine their distribution (i) at the cell-cell contact vs the cell-medium interfaces, (ii) at the contact rim vs central disc and (iii) at the contact edge vs inner contact.\n(i) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact and cell-medium interface, we measured the intensity Icc at cell-cell contacts and intensities Icm1 and Icm2 at the free surface of contacting cells 1 and 2. A 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line is manually drawn at the equatorial plane of the cell doublet to measure the mean intensities Icc, Icm1 and Icm2 at the corresponding interfaces.\n(ii) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact rim and central disc, we measured the intensities Idisc and Iring, with the latter one defined as a 1 \u00b5m thick circle at the rim of the contact. A 4 \u00b5m wide rectangle is drawn along the cell-cell contact to project it along the z axis using 3D project and interpolation functions of FIJI. On the projection, a circle is manually drawn around the entire cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. A 2 \u00b5m smaller circle is then positioned onto the center of the cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. To calculate the mean intensity Idisc, the total intensity of the small circle is divided by its area. To calculate the mean intensity Iring, the total intensity of the small circle is subtracted to the one of the large circle, the resulting intensity is divided by the area of the large circle to which the area of the small circle is subtracted.\n(iii) To account for the potential influence of depth of imaging in the analysis of the ring enrichment, we also performed a 2D analysis of Cdh1 and actin reorganization at the contact. Using a circle of radius 1 \u00b5m centered on the edge of contact, we measure the intensities of signal at both contact edges Iedge1 and Iedge2 of the equatorial plane of contact. We then measure intensity along the inner part of the cell-cell contact Iinner contact (excluding the edges) using a 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line. We then calculate the ratio between the average Iedge1 and Iedge2 and the Iinner contact.\n"

        "description": "While commensal bacteria generally respect natural barriers of the human body, pathogens are able to breach epithelia, invade deeper tissue layers and cause life-threatening infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen, is a leading cause of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, with mortality rates up to 50% in mechanically ventilated patients1\u20133. Effective colonization and breaching of lung mucosa are hallmarks of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis4. Although virulence factors and behavioral strategies of P. aeruginosa have been described5,6, it has remained unclear how this pathogen disseminates on functional mucosal surfaces, how it avoids mucociliary clearance and how it invades the tissue barrier. Using fully differentiated human lung epithelia, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa efficiently spreads on the apical tissue surface before it breaches epithelia by preferentially invading mucus secreting goblet cells. Internalization leads to host cell death and expulsion and the formation of ruptures of the epithelial barrier. Rupture sites are rapidly colonized by extracellular bacteria through active chemotaxis, leading to increasing tissue damage and successful pathogen translocation to the unprotected basolateral side of the epithelium. We show that cell invasion is promoted by two Type-6 toxin secretion systems (T6SS), while Type-3 (T3SS) mediates cell death of infected goblet cells. T3SS mutants invade goblet cells normally, but internalized bacteria fail to trigger goblet cell expulsion and instead show unrestrained intracellular replication. While the effective shedding of infected host cells reveals potent tissue protection mechanisms, the discovery of an intracellular lifestyle of P. aeruginosa in pseudostratified human lung epithelia provides new entry points into investigating the intersection of antibiotic and immune mechanisms during lung infections. By demonstrating that P. aeruginosa uses a combination of specific virulence factors and collective behavior to invade goblet cells and breach the lung tissue barrier from within, these studies reveal novel mechanisms underlying lung infection dynamics under physiological conditions.

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 104 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Gribnau).\nmESCs were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS; ThermoFisher), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin/ 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all from Life Technologies) and 1000 U/mL LIF (made in-house). Cells were grown on gelatin-coated plates under standard cell culture conditions (37oC, 5% CO2, humid) on a \u2018feeder\u2019 layer of SNLP mouse fibroblasts mitotically inactivated by Mitomycin-C (Sigma Aldrich). mESCs were routinely passaged at ~80% confluency every 2-3 days using TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher). Before experiments, feeder cells were removed by pre-plating to gelatinised cell culture dishes for 30-40 min, with slower-attaching mESCs taken from suspension and plated to new gelatinised dishes.\nXist expression from the TetOn promoter was induced by addition of 1\u00b5g/ml doxycycline (Sigma, D9891). dTAG-13 (Tocris, #6605) was applied to FKBP12F36V-fusion cell lines at 100 nM to induce protein degradation."

Images were captured using the ZEN Imaging Software and processed in Fiji (ImageJ v1.53). \n\nsmRNA-FISH: images were acquired using a LSM880 confocal microscope with an Airyscan system. The Airyscan system has 32-channel GaAsP (Gallium Arsenide Phosphide) detectors, which allow to obtain images with enhanced spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than in traditional LSM systems (Huff 2015). A 63x/1,4 OIL DICII PL APO objective was used. Images were processed in Fiji (ImageJ v1.53).\n\nLive imaging: time-lapse images were acquired using an LSM780 or LSM880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 10x/0,3 DICI EC PL NEOFLUAR, for imaging at the tissue scale. Explants were cultured in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 during imaging. To analyze branching morphogenesis in embryonic mammary buds, images were acquired at 8 mm Z intervals over approximately 80 mm thickness and 60 min intervals for 12-48 hr.\n",

Mammary cultures were maintained in a tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The culture media was replaced every two days. For growth factor assays, 1 nM FGF10 (Bio-techne, 6224-FG) was added to the medium at day 4. For experiments using the FGFR inhibitor, mammary buds were collected from E13.5 female embryos and maintained in culture for 4 days, after which 50 nM BGJ398 (Selleckchem, S2183) or DMSO in control wells were added and renewed every two days until day 9 in culture.

        "release_date": "2024-06-14",
        "description": "During preimplantation development, mouse embryos form a fluid-filled lumen, which sets their first axis of symmetry1,2. Pressurized fluid breaks open cell-cell contacts and accumulates into pockets, which gradually coarsen into a single lumen3\u20135. During coarsening, cellular adhesive and contractile properties are thought to guide intercellular fluid (IF) but what cell behavior may control fluid movements is unknown. Here, we report large fluid-filled spherical membrane intrusions called inverse blebs6,7 growing into cells at adhesive contacts. At the onset of lumen coarsening, we observed hundreds of inverse blebs throughout the embryo, each dynamically filling with IF and retracting within a minute. We find that inverse blebs grow due to pressure build-up resulting from luminal fluid accumulation and cell-cell adhesion, which locally confines fluid. Inverse blebs then retract due to actomyosin contraction, which effectively redistributes fluid within the intercellular space. Importantly, inverse blebs show topological specificity and mostly occur at contacts between two cells, rarely at contacts formed by multiple cells, which essentially serve as fluid sinks. Manipulating the topology of the embryo reveals that, in the absence of sinks, inverse blebs pump fluid into one another in a futile cycle. We propose that inverse blebs operate as hydraulic pumps to promote luminal coarsening, thereby constituting an instrument used by cells to control fluid movement.",

Data are plotted using Graphpad Prism 9.5.1.\n\nInverse bleb count\nThe inverse bleb number in confocal and light-sheet time lapses is manually counted. A bleb is defined as a transient hemispherical actin-positive intrusion appearing at cell-cell contacts. \nWhen embryos are imaged every minute continuously throughout lumen formation, the number of blebs is provided as such. When embryos are sampled every 5 or 10 s, the number of blebs is provided per min.\nInverse blebs are allocated to TE or ICM cells based on the position of the cells: TE cells contact the surface of the embryo while ICM cells are surrounded by other cells.\nInverse blebs are allocated into a distal and proximal half by determining the site of blastocoel formation in the equatorial plane and bisecting the embryo in two equal halves.\nInverse blebs are allocated to: (1) a bicellular interface when they do not touch a multicellular interface and are oriented away from the bicellular interface; (2) a multicellular interface when they touch that interface and are oriented away from the multicellular interface; (3) an unclear category when they touch a multicellular interface and are oriented away from a neighboring bicellular interface,\n\nDuration of the microlumen phase\nMicrolumen duration of embryos, quartets and doublets is determined as the time between the appearance of the first and disappearance of the last microlumens as detected visually.\n\nDynamics of individual inverse blebs\nInverse bleb dynamics are measured using FIJI by tracing the outline of inverse blebs using a line width of 1 \u00b5m. Before and after inverse bleb formation and retraction, a line corresponding to the opening width of the inverse bleb is measured. For each inverse bleb, measurements are taken 82.5 s before and after reaching their maximum size (90 s after size maximum for para-Nitroblebbistatin treatment).\nThe time of maximal size of each inverse bleb is taken as a reference time point. Intensity values of LifeAct-GFP, MYH9-GFP, CDH1-GFP and mTmG are first normalized to 82.5 s before inverse bleb size maximum and then to their minimal and maximal values. The lifetime of an inverse bleb is taken as the time during which a visible membrane protrusion is seen extending at a cell-cell contact until the time it is no longer visible. The retraction time is taken as the time of inverse bleb duration from its maximal size to its disappearance.\nUsing R segmented package54, the LifeAct-GFP and MYH9-GFP recruitment times are calculated using iterative linear regression on the intensity data taken until the maximum value to find the breakpoint between the stable intensity and intensity increase.\n\nBlastocoel volume\nBlastocoel volume is measured on full-volume light sheet z-stacks using the FIJI plugin LimeSeg55. The blastocoel is traced back from the expanded blastocyst and measured as soon as a lumen is present (smallest segmented lumen < 1 pL). Before that, blastocoel volume is assumed to be 0 pL.\n\nStatistics\nStatistical test were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10\u22122. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments.\n"

Emission is collected through 514/30 and 592/25 band pass filters onto an ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera (C11440, Hamamatsu).\nBoth microscopes are equipped with an incubation chamber to keep the sample at 37\u00b0C and supply the atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nIn order to capture the dynamics of inverse blebs, WT embryos expressing LifeAct-GFP and mTmG or Myh9-GFP and mTmG, mMyh9+/- or mMyh10+/- embryos expressing LifeAct-GFP and mTmG are imaged every 6.9 s for 412 s at their equatorial plane, which is repeated every 1 h from late E2.5 to E3.5 using a custom Metamorph journal (Molecular Devices). A 60 \u00b5m z-stack with a 5 \u00b5m step size is acquired before every time lapse to discern TE and ICM cells.\nTo measure microlumen duration in WT, mCdh1+/- or mMyh9+/-  embryos, embryos expressing mTmG are imaged every 5 min for from E2.5 to E3.5, capturing a z-stack of 28 \u00b5m of the upper half of each embryo with a 4 \u00b5m step size.\nIn order to simultaneously track inverse bleb number and/or microlumens, WT or mCdh1+/- embryos, WT/WT and mMyh9+/-/WT chimeras, doublets and quartets are imaged at the equatorial plane every 1 min from before microlumen initiation until lumen formation is completed.\n",

METASPACE-ML is a machine learning-based approach addressing this challenge which incorporates new scores and computationally-efficient False Discovery Rate estimation. For training and evaluation, we use a comprehensive set of 1,710 datasets from 159 researchers from 47 labs encompassing both animal and plant-based datasets representing multiple spatial metabolomics contexts derived from the METASPACE knowledge base. Here we show that, METASPACE-ML outperforms its rule-based predecessor, exhibiting higher precision, increased throughput, and enhanced capability in identifying low-intensity and biologically-relevant metabolites.",

        "title": "Visualization of cellular membrane damage and apoptosis in murine precision cut lung slices after vibratome slicing",
        "release_date": "2024-07-22",
        "description": "Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) are increasingly being utilized to reduce animal usage (as more experiments can be performed on complex and multicellular tissues from a single animal) but also offer the potential to study cellular and tissue level processes directly in human tissue ex vivo. PCLS can be generated using several different techniques including a vibrating microtome (vibratome) or other commercial devices such as a Krumdieck slicer or Compresstome. Due to the potential damage from mechanical cutting of the tissue and from the cold ischemic time associated with tissue preparation, some labs report letting PCLS rest overnight or for 24 hours prior to starting experiments. However, there is limited data on what occurs immediately after slicing and what time window is optimal for PCLS recovery prior to the start of experiments. This is particularly important to determine if PCLS are to be used for evaluation of targeted therapies, such as nanoparticle therapies. Non-specific uptake due to cell membrane damage may obfuscate the interpretation of results. Previous papers in the PCLS field have utilized live/dead staining which relies on Calcein AM staining which is cleaved cleaved by intracellular esterases to yield Calcein fluorescence, which is only retained in live cells. In parallel, Ethidium homodimer I (or III) are used to label dead or dying cells as this dye is impermeant to intact cell membranes. Ethidium homodimer is weakly fluorescent at baseline but becomes highly fluorescent when complexed with nucleic acids. However, this approach has several drawbacks. 1) It does not yield insight into whether cell damage detected with Calcein AM is due to apoptosis or necrosis 2) Both dyes have excitation and emission spectra in ranges that overlap with lung tissue autofluorescence (Calcein AM ex=494nm and em=514nm; EtHD ex 527nm and em=624nm). Therefore, we sought to establish the feasibility of utilizing an active caspase3/7 sensitive dye (NucView\u00ae488) and a far red cell impermeable dye which more specifically labels nuclei (RedDot\u21222) to complement the information available in the literature to better understand the early dynamics in PCLS. These results help to establish suitable time windows for letting PCLS recover prior to beginning experiments, provide insight into the potential for apoptotic pathways to be initiated after slicing and help to establish when such live staining agents should be administered to evaluate potential cell death. We generated 300\u03bcm thick PCLS from agarose filled murine lungs and either immediately administered apoptosis/necrosis dyes or administered them 24 hours later. To test for dye stability and as a positive control for cellular damage, we administered 150\u03bcM hydrogen peroxide to some slices. Images were acquired using confocal microscopy using identical laser and microscope settings over multiple days. There was no internal calibration performed between days. ",

        "description": "Proper chromosome segregation is crucial for cell division. In eukaryotes, this is achieved by the kinetochore, an evolutionarily conserved multi-protein complex that physically links the DNA to spindle microtubules and takes an active role in monitoring and correcting erroneous spindle-chromosome attachments. Our mechanistic understanding of these functions and how they ensure an error-free outcome of mitosis is still limited, partly because we lack a complete understanding of the kinetochore structure in the cell. In this study, we use single-molecule localization microscopy to visualize individual kinetochore complexes in situ in budding yeast. For major kinetochore proteins, we measured their abundance and position within the metaphase kinetochore. Based on this comprehensive dataset, we propose a quantitative model of the budding yeast kinetochore. While confirming many aspects of previous reports based on bulk imaging, our results present a unifying nanoscale model of the kinetochore in budding yeast.",

        "description": "Dynamic measurements of molecular machines can provide invaluable insights into their mechanism, but have been challenging in living cells. Here, we developed live-cell tracking of single fluorophores with nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution in 2D and 3D using the recently introduced super-resolution technique MINFLUX. This allowed us to resolve the precise stepping motion of the motor protein kinesin-1 as it walks on microtubules in living cells. In addition, nanoscopic tracking of motors walking on the microtubules of fixed cells enabled us to resolve the architecture of the microtubule cytoskeleton with protofilament resolution. Our approach will enable future in vivo studies of motor protein kinetics in complex environments and super-resolution mapping of dense microtubule arrays, and paves the way towards monitoring functional conformational changes of protein machines at high spatiotemporal resolution in living systems.",

To image the whole HPF carrier volume and locate single organoids, we first detected cell nuclei marked with Hoechst-33342 and acquired z-stacks with 6x6 tiles of 5122 pixels with 10% overlap, and 10 \u03bcm z-step. The final montage was stitched using ZEN-black software. For single organoids, we acquired z-stacks of 10242 pixels at different z-steps ranging from 1.0 or 1.8 \u03bcm. ",

        "description": "We developed a pipeline to generate bioprinted tumor organoids linked to label-free, time-resolved imaging via high-speed live cell interferometry (HSLCI) and machine learning-based quantitation of individual organoids. Bioprinting cells gives rise to 3D organoid structures that preserve tumor histology and gene expression. HSLCI imaging in tandem with machine learning-based image segmentation and organoid classification tools enables accurate, label-free parallel mass measurements for thousands of bioprinted organoids. We demonstrate that this strategy identifies organoid transiently or persistently sensitive or resistant to specific therapies, providing detailed, actionable information to guide rapid therapy selection.\nThe imaging files uploaded are the unwrapped phase images for each imaging position stored in .mat files. We have also uploaded the .xcf files used to manually create the segmentation masks used to train the neural network to segment the organoids.",

Mini-squares with side length 3.9mm were printed into glass-bottom plates (Cellvis P96-1.5H-N) for drug screening and HSLCI imaging. The mini-squares were inscribed within the circular well with sides parallel to the sides of the well plate. All bioprinting processes utilized the same material deposited for manually seeded organoids: a single-cell suspension in a 3:4 mixture of Mammocult and Matrigel on ice. After vortexing briefly, the mixture was transferred into a 3 mL syringe to remove air bubbles. The mixture was then transferred to a room temperature 3 mL bioprinter cartridge (CELLINK) by connecting the syringe and cartridge with a double-sided female Luer lock adapter (CELLINK). The loaded cartridge was incubated in a rotating incubator (Enviro-Genie, Scientific Industries) for 30 minutes at the print temperature.\nDuring the incubation period, the printer was sterilized with the built-in UV irradiation function, the printhead was set to the print temperature, and the masked 96-well plates were treated with oxygen plasma.  Briefly, well masks were autoclaved prior to use, inserted into the well plate, and pressed in contact with the glass surface. Masked plates were treated with oxygen plasma in a PE-25 (Plasma Etch) for 30-90 seconds, 15 minutes prior to bioprinting. After plasma treatment, the well plate was placed in the bioprinter and Automatic Bed Levelling (ABL) was performed.\nOnce the incubation period ended, a 0.5\u201d 25-gauge needle (CELLINK) was attached to the cartridge which was loaded into the pre-cooled printhead. The printer was primed by extruding a small volume of material at 10-15 kPa prior to calibrating the printer. The material in the needle gelled during the printer calibration which took approximately 2 minutes. After calibration, a second extrusion using 40 kPa was performed to clear the needle of the gelled material prior to starting the print and ensure unobstructed material extrusion. To create constructs of the appropriate thicknesses, prints in 8-well plates were extruded at 15 kPa while prints in 96-well plates were extruded at 7-15 kPa. Each print of mini-squares in a 96-well plate is deposited by the bioprinter in approximately four minutes. After printing, the constructs were imaged and incubated at 37\u00b0C for at least 30 minutes to solidify the matrix and 100\u03bcL of Mammocult medium was then added.

The printer was primed by extruding a small volume of material at 10-15 kPa prior to calibrating the printer. The material in the needle gelled during the printer calibration which took approximately 2 minutes. After calibration, a second extrusion using 40 kPa was performed to clear the needle of the gelled material prior to starting the print and ensure unobstructed material extrusion. To create constructs of the appropriate thicknesses, prints in 8-well plates were extruded at 15 kPa while prints in 96-well plates were extruded at 7-15 kPa. Each print of mini-squares in a 96-well plate is deposited by the bioprinter in approximately four minutes.

The loaded cartridge was incubated in a rotating incubator (Enviro-Genie, Scientific Industries) for 30 minutes at the print temperature.\nDuring the incubation period, the printer was sterilized with the built-in UV irradiation function, the printhead was set to the print temperature, and the masked 96-well plates were treated with oxygen plasma.  Briefly, well masks were autoclaved prior to use, inserted into the well plate, and pressed in contact with the glass surface. Masked plates were treated with oxygen plasma in a PE-25 (Plasma Etch) for 30-90 seconds, 15 minutes prior to bioprinting. After plasma treatment, the well plate was placed in the bioprinter and Automatic Bed Levelling (ABL) was performed.\nOnce the incubation period ended, a 0.5\u201d 25-gauge needle (CELLINK) was attached to the cartridge which was loaded into the pre-cooled printhead. The printer was primed by extruding a small volume of material at 10-15 kPa prior to calibrating the printer. The material in the needle gelled during the printer calibration which took approximately 2 minutes. After calibration, a second extrusion using 40 kPa was performed to clear the needle of the gelled material prior to starting the print and ensure unobstructed material extrusion. To create constructs of the appropriate thicknesses, prints in 8-well plates were extruded at 15 kPa while prints in 96-well plates were extruded at 7-15 kPa. Each print of mini-squares in a 96-well plate is deposited by the bioprinter in approximately four minutes. After printing, the constructs were imaged and incubated at 37\u00b0C for at least 30 minutes to solidify the matrix and 100\u03bcL of Mammocult medium was then added. Organoids were grown for 72 hours prior to drug treatment and imaging with HSLCI.\n"

        "release_date": "2023-03-01",
        "description": "The plant immune system relies on the perception of molecules that signal the presence of a microbe threat. This triggers signal transduction that mediates a range of cellular responses via a collection of molecular machinery including receptors, small molecules, and enzymes. One response to pathogen perception is the restriction of cell-to-cell communication by plasmodesmal closure. We previously found that while chitin and flg22 trigger specialized immune signaling cascades in the plasmodesmal plasma membrane, both execute plasmodesmal closure via callose synthesis at the plasmodesmata. This indicates the signaling pathways ultimately converge at or upstream of callose synthesis. To establish the hierarchy of signaling at plasmodesmata and characterize points of convergence in microbe elicitor-triggered signaling, we profiled the dependence of plasmodesmal responses triggered by different elicitors on a range of plasmodesmal signaling machinery. We identified that, like chitin, flg22 signals via RBOHD to induce plasmodesmal closure. Further, we found that PDLP1, PDLP5 and CALS1 are common to microbe- and SA-triggered responses, identifying PDLPs as a candidate signaling nexus. To understand how PDLPs relay a signal to CALS1, we screened for PDLP5 interactors and found NHL3, which is also required for chitin-, flg22- and SA-triggered plasmodesmal responses and PDLP-mediated activation of callose synthesis. We conclude that a PDLP-NHL3 complex acts as an integrating node of plasmodesmal signaling cascades, transmitting multiple immune signals to activate CALS1 and plasmodesmata closure.",

        "description": "FAM3C/ILEI is an important cytokine for tumor progression and metastasis. However, its involvement in inflammation remains elusive. Here, we show that ILEI protein is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions. Inducible keratinocyte-specific ILEI overexpression in mice (K5-ILEIind) recapitulates many aspects of psoriasis following TPA challenge, primarily manifested by impaired epidermal differentiation and increased neutrophil recruitment. Mechanistically, ILEI triggers Erk and Akt signaling, which then activate STAT3 via Ser727 phosphorylation. Keratinocyte-specific ILEI deletion ameliorates TPA-induced skin inflammation. A transcriptomic ILEI signature obtained from the K5-ILEIind model shows enrichment in several signaling pathways also found in psoriasis and identifies urokinase as a targetable enzyme to counteract ILEI activity. Pharmacological inhibition of urokinase in TPA-induced K5-ILEIind mice results in significant improvement of psoriasiform symptoms by reducing ILEI secretion. The ILEI signature distinguishes psoriasis from healthy skin with uPA ranking among the top \u201cseparator\u201d genes. Our study identifies ILEI as a key driver in psoriasis, indicates the relevance of ILEI-regulated genes for disease manifestation and shows the clinical impact of ILEI and urokinase as novel potential therapeutic targets in psoriasis.",

        "description": "Fluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a key method for observing protein distribution, dynamics, and interaction with other proteins in living cells. However, the typical approach using overexpression of tagged proteins can perturb cell behavior and introduce localization artifacts. To preserve native expression, fluorescent proteins can be inserted directly into endogenous genes. This approach has been widely used in yeast for decades, and more recently in invertebrate model organisms with the advent of CRISPR/Cas9. However, endogenous FP tagging has not been widely used in mammalian cells due to inefficient homology-directed repair. Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

We have developed dual image and DNA (ID)-coding, which identifies individual single cells in both live image and sequencing data spaces. Samples provided here are relevant to proof-of-concept studies of ID-coding presented in the associated publication.\nOptically-coded micro-particles were encapsulated in hydrogel droplets with or without single cells. Multiple hydrogel droplets were imaged in individual microscopic views, which were segmented afterwards. ",

        "release_date": "2023-07-12",
        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0051.  Light sheet microscopy has been previously used to image and directly study the process of gastrulation in a zebrafish embryo. Before now it was not possible to use this method to study late-stage somatogenesis, due to the movement of the embryo, resulting in displacement from the field of view. Here we achieve 4D light sheet imaging with online, image based registration to maintain the field of view during long timelapses, with emphasis on the tailbud. The zebrafish tailbud is of special interest as it contains a population of bipotent progenitor cells, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMps), competent to enter either the mesodermal or neural lineages. This dataset provides in toto tracking of the tailbud of the developing zebrafish whilst also demonstrating the potential of online tracking during developing to maintain high magnification images whilst tracking a growing object.",

The sheet was generated using 2-4% laser output power at 488\u2005nm (200\u2005mW maximum output power), delivered to the sample using a Nikon 10\u00d7, 0.3NA water-immersion objective and a galvo scanning system (Cambridge Technology). The sheet thickness determined before the experiment in dye solution was \u223c2\u2005\u03bcm at the waist. Fluorescence was collected with a Nikon 40\u00d7, 0.8 NA water-immersion objective, using a 525/50\u2005nm (Chroma Technologies) emission filter in front of the sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Flash 4). The position of the detection lens was synchronized with the position of the excitation sheet using a long travel piezo objective positioner (Physik Instrumente).",

Lengths and widths were obtained using the Measure function from the Analyze menu and the results saved in CSV files. To automate the measurement of area, a pixel classification model was trained using LabKit (Arzt et al. 2022) by selecting representative foreground and background areas. The imaging data was segmented subsequently with StarDist (WEIGERT et al. 2020) using the above classifier. StarDist automatically classified objects in the images into foreground and background and areas classified as foreground were then measured using the Measure function from the Analyze menu and results were saved. CSV files with all individual morphometric measurements of all specimens were joined into one single table and used for subsequent data analyses."

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

Lengths and widths were obtained using the Measure function from the Analyze menu and the results saved in CSV files. To automate the measurement of area, a pixel classification model was trained using LabKit (Arzt et al. 2022) by selecting representative foreground and background areas. The imaging data was segmented subsequently with StarDist (WEIGERT et al. 2020) using the above classifier. StarDist automatically classified objects in the images into foreground and background and areas classified as foreground were then measured using the Measure function from the Analyze menu and results were saved. CSV files with all individual morphometric measurements of all specimens were joined into one single table and used for subsequent data analyses."

To automate the measurement of area, a pixel classification model was trained using LabKit (Arzt et al. 2022) by selecting representative foreground and background areas. The imaging data was segmented subsequently with StarDist (WEIGERT et al. 2020) using the above classifier. StarDist automatically classified objects in the images into foreground and background and areas classified as foreground were then measured using the Measure function from the Analyze menu and results were saved. CSV files with all individual morphometric measurements of all specimens were joined into one single table and used for subsequent data analyses."

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used.

To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications.

        "description": "A high-salt diet (HSD) elicits sustained sterile inflammation and worsens tissue injury. However, how this occurs after stroke, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, remains unknown. Here, we report that HSD impaired long-term brain recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage, a severe form of stroke, despite salt withdrawal prior to the injury. Mechanistically, HSD induced innate immune priming and training in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by downregulation of NR4a family and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This training compromised alternative activation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) without altering the initial inflammatory responses of the stroke brain. Healthy mice transplanted with bone marrow from HSD-fed mice retained signatures of reduced MDM reparative functions, further confirming a persistent form of innate immune memory that originates in the bone marrow. Lack of NR4a1 in macrophages recapitulated HSD-induced negative impacts on stroke outcomes while gain of NR4a1 enabled stroke recovery in HSD animals. Together, we provide the first evidence that links HSD-induced innate immune memory to the acquisition of persistent dysregulated inflammatory responses and unveils NR4a1 as a potential therapeutic target.",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0035.  The application of high-content imaging in conjunction with multivariate clustering techniques has recently shown value in the confirmation of cellular activity and further characterization of drug mode of action following pharmacologic perturbation. However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.  Note: The images in idr0035/screenA were generated by Caie et al, 2010 and are from MCF7 wild-type cells only.  They were obtained from the Broad BioImage Benchmark Collection image set BBBC021v1.

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0033.  We hypothesized that human genes and disease-associated alleles might be systematically functionally annotated using morphological profiling of cDNA constructs, via a microscopy-based Cell Painting assay. Indeed, 50% of the 220 tested genes yielded detectable morphological profiles, which grouped into biologically meaningful gene clusters consistent with known functional annotation (e.g., the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade). We used novel subpopulation-based visualization methods to interpret the morphological changes for specific clusters. This unbiased morphologic map of gene function revealed TRAF2/c-REL negative regulation of YAP1/WWTR1-responsive pathways. We confirmed this discovery of functional connectivity between the NF-kB pathway and Hippo pathway effectors at the transcriptional level, thereby expanding knowledge of these two signaling pathways that critically regulate tumor initiation and progression. We make the images and raw data publicly available, providing an initial morphological map of major biological pathways for future study.",

Despite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival. As part of the Mitocheck consortium, this study provides an in-depth analysis of cell division phenotypes and makes the entire high-content data set available as a resource to the community.",

This classifier automatically recognizes changes in nuclear morphology due to the cell cycle, cell death or other phenotypic changes with an overall accuracy of 87% (Supplementary Fig. 1) and allows us to convert each time-lapse movie into a phenotypic profile that quantifies the response to each siRNA (Fig. 1a). In addition, the position of each nucleus is tracked over time. Using stringent significance thresholds for each morphological class, nuclear mobility as well as proliferation rate, significant and reproducible (majority of three or more technical replicates) deviations caused by each siRNA are computed (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods)."

Stabilized light sources (MT20, Olympus-Biosystems, Munich), firewire cameras (DB-H1, 1300x1024, Olympus-Biosystems) and an in house modified version of the ScanR software (now commercially available with all new developments from OSIS), EMBL environmental microscope incubator (EMBL, GP 106) as well as a new objective (Plan10x, NA 0.4; Olympus-Europe) and filter sets for GFP (Chroma Inc.) were implemented. An image based autofocusing routine22 was used to focus on the maximum number of interphase cells (scoring size, intensity, contrast) in a field of view. The focus z-coordinates of the transfected cell microarray were saved during the first round of imaging. The temperature stability of the incubated system allowed us to reuse the saved focus map for 48 hours without further autofocusing between the 30 min imaging intervals. As cells needed on average ~1 hour to go through mitosis, we obtained ~2 mitotic images per cell enabling us to detect delays  30 minutes, or a mitotic index change from 5 % to 7.5 %. Higher time resolution would increase the sensitivity to even more subtle delays but increase overall data volume. Illumination of the specimen was reduced to the minimum necessary for sufficient signal to noise ratio for automated phenotyping (see below) with exposure times of 18-50 ms (GFP). Data was compressed without loss (ZIP) on the fly, buffered locally on the microscope computers and then saved on a 5 TB network-attached-storage. Microscopes were connected via a 2 GBit/s network to the NAS to sustain uninterrupted data flow.",

Kinetochores serve both a structural role linking chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and a regulatory role, controlling the timing of mitosis via the spindle assembly checkpoint. To identify proteins that regulate the kinetochore we used a genome-wide fluorescence microscopy approach. We combined an array of mutants of either non-essential gene deletions or essential temperature-sensitive alleles with fluorescently tagged spindle pole bodies (centrosome) and outer kinetochores. Quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed mutants that affect the levels and distribution of kinetochores respectively. These mutants are enriched for those involved in mRNA processing, chromatin organization, DNA replication/repair and mitosis. Our data show that the Pkc1 kinase maintains the kinetochore focus via its ability to prevent cell stress and this phenotype is rescued by an osmotic stabilizer. These data support the notion that kinetochore and microtubule homeostasis are perturbed by the stress response pathways. Hence this observation provides a candidate mechanism for extracellular stress leading to chromosome segregation defects.",

These 48 pad arrays were covered with a custom-sized 175 \u00b5m thick coverslip and imaged on an upright epifluoresence microscope (Zeiss Axiovision Z2), using a 63x 1.4NA plan apochromat oil immersion lens. Zeiss Immersol 518F immersion oil was used with a refractive index of 1.5181. Fluorescence illumination for the screen was provided by a 100W mercury bulb. Fluorescence filter cubes were as follows: YFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 46 (excitation BP 500/20; dichroic FT 515, emission BP 535/30), RFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 63HE (excitation BP 572/25; dichroic FT 590, emission BP 629/62), GFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 38HE (excitation BP 470/40; dichroic FT 495, emission BP 525/50) and CFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 47HE (excitation BP 436/25; dichroic FT455, emission BP 480/40). Later experiments employed a Zeiss Colibri LED illumination system (445 nm for CFP excitation, 470 nm for GFP excitation, 505 nm for YFP excitation and 590nm for RFP excitation), with the filter cubes outlined above. A z stack of 21 images with a vertical separation of 350 nm was acquired for each strain. Brightfield contrast was enhanced with differential interference contrast (DIC) prisms. The resulting light was captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA ERII CCD camera with 6.45 \u00b5m pixels, binned 2\u00d72 or a Flash 4.0 Lte CMOS camera with 6.5 \u00b5m pixels, binned 2\u00d72 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan).

        "description": "Modelling chronic cortical demyelination allows to study long-lasting pathological changes ob-served in multiple sclerosis such as failure of remyelination, chronically disturbed functions of oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes, brain atrophy and cognitive impairments. We aimed at generating an animal model for studying the consequences of chronic cortical demyelination and meningeal inflammation. To induce long-lasting cortical demyelination and chronic meningeal inflammation, we immunized female Lewis rats against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and injected lentiviruses for continuing overexpression of the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 in the cortical brain parenchyma. Immunization with MOG and overexpression of TNF\uf061 and IFN\uf067 led to widespread subpial demyelination and meningeal inflammation stable for at least 10 weeks. We demonstrate here that immunization with MOG is necessary for acute as well as chronic cortical demyelination. In addition, long-lasting overexpression of TNF\uf061 and IFN\uf067 in the brain paren-chyma is sufficient to induce chronic meningeal inflammation. Our model simulates key features of chronic cortical demyelination and inflammation, reminiscent of human multiple sclerosis pathology. This will allow molecular, cellular and functional investigations for a better under-standing of the adaptation mechanisms of the cerebral cortex in multiple sclerosis.",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0010.  DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. We showed previously that RNF8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at DSBs. Here, we provide evidence that, while RNF8 is necessary to trigger the DSB-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. We identified RNF168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. We show that RNF168 interacts with ubiquitylated H2A, assembles at DSBs in an RNF8-dependent manner, and, by targeting H2A and H2AX, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, RNF168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between E3 ligases in genome maintenance.",

Image processing was performed for the whole dataset using standard ImageJ features for noise reduction, segmentation, filtering and thresholding. In all acquired frames, the nuclei were detected using the Hoechst signal. Within the detected nuclei, 53BP1 foci number and intensity were measured using the Alexa 488 fluorescent signal. After recording these data, the average number of 53BP1 foci per nucleus was determined for each frame, and the resulting values were normalized to the mean number of foci in nuclei exposed to the non-targeting controls within the given siRNA microarray.  Prior to statistical analysis, out-of-focus images, images showing nuclear aberrations, or fields with excessive cell death were manually excluded from the dataset. To display the impact of each siRNA on 53BP1 focus formation, we ranked the resulting data according to their z-score: Z = (X - u) / sigma where X is the raw score, sigma is the standard deviation of the population and u the mean of the population. In addition to the automated image analysis, each acquired frame was seen by two independent investigators to validate the results from the automated readout. If at least one siRNA scored positively by these criteria, we considered it as a potential 'hit' and put it aside for secondary screens and in depth characterization."

The Hoechst-associated fluorescence (exposure time 10 ms) was used for automated identification of the focal plane. The exposure time to record the 53BP1-associated fluorescence was 30 ms.

        "description": "Human rhinovirus is the most frequently isolated virus during severe exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this disease, alveolar macrophages display significantly diminished phagocytic functions that could be associated with bacterial superinfections. However, how human rhinovirus affects the functions of macrophages is largely unknown. Macrophages treated with HRV16 demonstrated deficient bacteria killing activity, impaired phagolysosome biogenesis and altered intracellular compartments. Using RNA sequencing, we identified the small GTPase ARL5b to be upregulated by the virus in primary human macrophages. Importantly, depletion of ARL5b rescued bacterial clearance and localization of endosomal markers in macrophages upon HRV16 exposure. In permissive cells, depletion of ARL5b increased the secretion of HRV16 virions. Thus, we identify ARL5b as a novel regulator of intracellular trafficking dynamics and phagolysosomal biogenesis in macrophages and as a restriction factor of HRV16 in permissive cells. ",

Larvae were then segmented using random forest-based Pixel Classification in ilastik. The random forest classifier was trained interactively on 36 images with 613 and 1662 annotated pixels for foreground, and background, respectively, using all available default features. The resulting probability maps were thresholded at 0.5 for use in Tracking in ilastik. Division and Object-Count classifiers were trained interactively using default tracking features. The training data for tracking was augmented by adding time frames 0, 5, 10, and 15 from 39 datasets. This was done in order to improve count estimates for under-segmented agglomerations of larvae, often present at the beginning of the time series."

We identified extensive layer-enriched expression signatures and refined associations to previous laminar markers. We overlaid our laminar expression signatures on large-scale single nucleus RNA-sequencing data, enhancing spatial annotation of expression-driven clusters. By integrating neuropsychiatric disorder gene sets, we showed differential layer-enriched expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting the clinical relevance of spatially defined expression. We then developed a data-driven framework to define unsupervised clusters in spatial transcriptomics data, which can be applied to other tissues or brain regions in which morphological architecture is not as well defined as cortical laminae. Last, we created a web application for the scientific community to explore these raw and summarized data to augment ongoing neuroscience and spatial transcriptomics research (http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD).",

        "description": "Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient needed in many metabolic processes. To balance needs and potential toxicity, plants control the amount of Fe they take up and allocate to leaves and seeds during their development. One important regulator of this process is POPEYE (PYE). PYE is a Fe deficiency-induced key bHLH transcription factor (TF) for allocation of internal Fe in plants. In the absence of PYE, there is altered Fe translocation and plants develop a leaf chlorosis. NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE4 (NAS4), FERRIC-REDUCTION OXIDASE3 (FRO3), and ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR1 (ZIF1) genes are expressed at higher level in pye-1 indicating that PYE represses these genes. PYE activity is controlled in a yet unknown manner. Here, we show that a small Fe deficiency-induced protein OLIVIA (OLV) can interact with PYE. OLV has a conserved C-terminal motif, that we named TGIYY. Through deletion mapping, we pinpointed that OLV TGIYY and several regions of PYE can be involved in the protein interaction. An OLV overexpressing (OX) mutant line exhibited an enhanced NAS4 gene expression. This was a mild Fe deficiency response phenotype that was related to PYE function. Leaf rosettes of olv mutants remained smaller than those of wild type, indicating that OLV promotes plant growth. Taken together, our study identified a small protein OLV as a candidate that may connect aspects of Fe homeostasis with regulation of leaf growth.",

Technical details and detailed working principle are extensively described elsewhere (Prevedel et al., 2016)\u2060. The main difference with respect to the microscope design published by Prevedel et al. (2016) was a higher repetition laser (10 MHz, FemtoTrain, Spectra Physics). Laser power while scanning was kept below 191 mW, measured after the objective, to avoid heating the brain tissue excessively (Prevedel et al., 2016)\u2060. 470 \u03bcm2 fields of view were imaged at 128 px2 resolution and spaced in 15 \u03bcm z steps to cover 570 \u03bcm in depth (38 z steps) at a volume rate of 4.01 Hz. Artifacts produced by objective piezo z drive flyback were excluded from analysis.\n\tIn a typical imaging session, cranial window implanted mice were briefly (< 1 min) anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 for quick head fixation at a custom stage, slightly restraining their bodies inside a 5 cm diameter acrylic tube, and positioned under our custom 2P microscope. Mice fully recovered from the brief isoflurane anesthesia, showing a clear blinking reflex, whisking and sniffing behaviors and normal body posture and movements, immediately after head fixation. A pilot group of mice were habituated to the head fixed condition in daily 20 min sessions for 3 days, however we did not observe a marked contrast in the behavior of habituated versus unhabituated mice during our relatively short 25 min imaging sessions. In consequence imaging sessions never surpassed a maximum of 25 min, after which the mouse was returned to its home cage. Typically, mice were imaged a total of 2-11 times (sessions), one to three times a week. Volumetric imaging data was visualized and rendered using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012)\u2060. Motion correction was performed using NoRMCorre (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017)\u2060 on individual imaging planes from the volumetric datasets. jRGECO1a signal was extracted, denoised and neuropil corrected from each individual imaging plane using CaImAn (Giovannucci et al., 2019)\u2060. Spike probabilities were estimated using MLSpike (Deneux et al., 2016)\u2060. ",

The orientation of the membranes was tracked (blue sticks) and their coherency was computed. Local coherencies were visualized as thin red sticks of a certain length and angle emphasized by background colour. Global coherencies where shown as thick red sticks. Density functions revealed the distribution of local coherencies and the resulting mean local coherency and global coherency. The directions of local coherencies within each ROI were plotted as polar histograms respecting the 180-degree-symmetry and showed the computed angle of the global coherency. ",

        "description": "Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to cilia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for DLG1, a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, the retromer-associated protein SDCCAG3, IFT20 and polycystin-2 (PC2) were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 variant, p.T489R. Finally, biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling suggested that SDCCAG3 and IFT20 form a complex that associates, at least indirectly, with DLG1. Our work identifies a key role for DLG1 in regulating ciliary protein composition and suggests that ciliary dysfunction of the p.T489R DLG1 variant may contribute to CAKUT.  ",

        "description": "Although mitochondrial morphology changes have been consistently associated with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ageing, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms at play have remained somewhat obscure. Using a live-cell super-resolution (SR) microscopy technique, we have been able to identify different HSCs subsets that feature mitochondria of distinct morphologies and spatial distributions. Integrating SR microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled us to classify approximately two hundred HSCs from both young and aged mice into five discrete clusters. These clusters show molecular profiles that mirror the varying states of mitochondria. Our integrated approach of RNA biomarker analysis and potential regulon assessment has unveiled hitherto unrecognized functions of GDF15 in mediating mitochondrial signals and morphologies that direct HSCs fate. Therefore, the combination of SR imaging with bioinformatics pipeline offers a notably effective method for the identification of critical molecular players in specific phases of cellular transition, utilizing a relatively small dataset.

All experiments used 100\u00d7, 1.30 numerical aperture (NA) oil objective lens and two laser beams 405 nm and 488 nm. Images were acquired with EMCCD (Andor, iXon3 897) and sCMOS (Hamamatsu, c14440-20up). All images were possessed with ImageJ software and sparse deconvolved with a commercial software (MicroscopeX FINER, CSR Biotech).",

        "description": "The abscission of floral organs and emergence of lateral roots in Arabidopsis is regulated by the peptide ligand INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) and the receptor protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2). During these cell separation processes, the plant induces defense-associated genes to protect against pathogen invasion. However, the molecular coordination between abscission and immunity has not been thoroughly explored. Here we show that IDA induces a release of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+) and apoplastic production of reactive oxygen species, which are signatures of early defense responses. In addition, we find that IDA promotes late defense responses by the transcriptional upregulation of genes known to be involved in immunity. When comparing the IDA induced early immune responses to known immune responses, such as those elicited by flagellin22 treatment, we observe both similarities and differences. We propose a molecular mechanism by which IDA promotes signatures of an immune response in cells destined for separation to guard them from pathogen attack.",

Measurements were performed using a confocal laser scanning microscopy Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X using a 20x multi NA 0.75 objective. Images were recorded with a frame rate of 5 seconds at 400 Hz. Seedling mounting was performed as described in (Krebs & Schumacher, 2013). The plant tissues were incubated overnight in half strength MS, 21\u00b0C and continuous light conditions before the day of imaging. [Ca2+]cyt in the abscission zone were detected using WT plants expressing R-GECO1 (Keinath et al., 2015). Abscission zones of position 7 were used. Mounting of the abscission zones were performed using the same device as for seedlings (Krebs & Schumacher, 2013). The abscission zones were incubated in half strength MS medium for 1 h before imaging. Measurements were performed with a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan using a Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 air NA 0.30 objective. Images were recorded with a frame rate of 10 seconds. R-GECO1 was excited with a white light laser at 561 nm and its emission was detected at 590 nm to 670 nm using a HyD detector. Laser power and gain settings were chosen for each experiment to maintain comparable intensity values. For mIDA and flg22 two-fold concentrations were prepared in half strength MS. mIDA or flg22 were added in a 1:1 volume ratio to the imaging chamber (final concentration 1 \u00b5M). ATP was prepared in a 100-fold concentration in half strength MS and added as a last treatment in a 1:100 volume ratio (final concentration 1 mM) to the imaging chamber as a positive control for activity of the R-GECO1 sensor (Movie 3). Image processing was performed in FIJI. These steps are: background subtraction, gaussian blur, MultiStackReg v1.45 (http://bradbusse.net/sciencedownloads.html), 32-bit conversion, threshold. Royal was used as a look up table. Fluorescence intensities of indicated ROIs were obtained from the 32-bit images (Krebs & Schumacher, 2013). Normalization was done using the following formula \u0394F/F = (F-F0)/F0 where F0 represents the mean of at least 1 min measurement without any treatment. R-GECO1 measurements were performed at the Center for Advanced imaging (CAi) at HHU and at NorMIC Imaging platform at the University of Oslo.",

Here, we developed a novel approach integrating highly multiplexed imaging, laser microdissection, and deep visual proteomics to spatially profile the proteomes of 21 distinct cell populations in human colorectal and tonsil cancers with high sensitivity. In colorectal tumors, we uncovered an immunosuppressive macrophage barrier impeding T cell infiltration and regionally altering lymphocyte proteomes. Spatial proteomic analysis revealed distinct functional states of T cells in different tumor compartments. ",

        "description": "Achieving complete tumor resection is challenging and can be improved by real-time fluorescence guided surgery with molecular-targeted probes. However, pre-clinical identification and validation of probes presents a lengthy process that is traditionally performed in animal models and hampered by inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity in target expression. To screen multiple probes at patient scale, we developed a multispectral real-time 3D imaging platform that implements organoid technology to effectively model patient tumor heterogeneity and, importantly, healthy human tissue binding.

The source to detector and source to object distances were set at 1519 mm and 940 mm respectively, which combined with a 3000 x 3000 dexels detector resulted in an isotropic voxel (edge) size of 86 \u03bcm. Acquisition was conducted using both horizontal and vertical field extension modes.  The horizontal field extension offsets the detector so only half the width of the sample is in field of view at any time. This allows for a sample that is wider than the detector to be imaged. This results in part (half) of the specimen being sampled during the initial 0 -180 degrees rotation, and the rest of the specimen scanned during the second 180 -360 degrees rotation, with an appropriate overlap (10-20%). The process was then repeated 3 times to cover the vertical height of the specimen, with overlaps to eliminate cone-beam beam artefacts. This gave a total scan time of approximately 1 hour 40 minutes. The collected radiographs are then combined in silico to provide the information required for the full field of horizontal view reconstruction by the diondo diControl software (v 1.9.1.62), and then the scans concatenated to provide the full vertical field of view. During the reconstruction ring artefact, bad pixel, beam hardening and truncation corrections were applied.",

Connexin 43 is the major protein linking astrocytes in networks across the brain. In the present dataset, images from three cortical areas (parietal, frontal, and insular) and basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, midbrain substantia nigra) were collected from 20 people with Parkinson's and 20 age-matched controls to reveal downregulation in connexin 43 punctate staining in Parkinson's. Punctate pattern was specifically affected in disease, which may indicate dysfunction in gap junctional coupling.",

The coexistence of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in a single patient presents a challenging scenario for clinical decision-making. In this study, we investigate the potential of DVP to provide insights into precision medicine strategies.

One image corresponds to one region of interest (ROI) and one channel. Six ROIs were imaged per well (culture). Cultures were imaged at different days and segmented as described in the publication. Three families of image features were extracted from the segmented nuclei (Intensity features, Morphology features, Texture features) and used for multivariate analysis and entropy analysis. See Manuscript and Table S4 for more explanations on the dataset.",

        "description": "The zebrafish Danio rerio has become a popular model host to explore disease pathology caused by infectious agents. A main advantage is its transparency at an early age, which enables live imaging of infection dynamics. While multispecies infections are common in patients, the zebrafish model is rarely used to study them, although the model would be ideal for investigating pathogen-pathogen and pathogen-host interactions. This may be due to the absence of an established multispecies infection protocol for a defined organ and the lack of suitable image analysis pipelines for automated image processing. To address these issues, we developed a protocol for establishing and tracking single and multispecies bacterial infections in the inner ear structure (otic vesicle) of the zebrafish by imaging. Subsequently, we generated an image analysis pipeline that involved deep learning for the automated segmentation of the otic vesicle, and scripts for the quantification of pathogen frequencies through fluorescence intensity measures. We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, three of the difficult-to-treat ESKAPE pathogens, to show that our infection protocol and image analysis pipeline work both for single pathogens and pairwise pathogen combinations. Thus, our protocols provide a comprehensive toolbox for studying single and multispecies infections in real-time in zebrafish.",

        "description": "Imaging data set from p21-IRES-GFP and Puma-tdTomato mice associated with the manuscript EMBOJ-2023-114787\n\nInvestigating how transcription factors control complex cellular processes requires tools that enable responses to be visualised at the single-cell level and their fate to be followed over time. For example, the tumour suppressor TP53/TRP53 can initiate diverse cellular responses by transcriptional activation of its target genes: Puma to induce apoptotic cell death and p21 to induce cell cycle arrest/cell senescence. However, it is not known how these processes are regulated and initiated in different cell types. To be able to examine this, we developed triple-FLAG TRP53 knock-in mice for TRP53 pull-down and two TRP53 response reporter mice, knocking tdTomato or GFP into the Puma/Bbc3 or p21 gene loci, respectively. By crossing the reporter mice onto a TRP53-deficient background, we could show that these reporters reliably inform on TRP53-dependent and TRP53-independent initiation of the apoptotic as well as the cell cycle arrest/senescence programs in vitro and even in vivo.

At mitotic entry, we\nfind that microtubule-based cortical pulling is lost. Quantitative\nmeasurements of cortical pulling and cytoplasmic pulling together\nwith physical simulations suggested that a wavelike loss of cortical\npulling at mitotic entry leads to aster centration based on cytoplasmic\npulling. Cortical actin is lost from the cortex at mitotic entry coincident\nwith a fall in cortical tension from \u223c300pN/\u03bcm to \u223c100pN/\u03bcm.\nFollowing the loss of cortical force generators at mitotic entry, long\nmicrotubule-based cytoplasmic pulling is sufficient to displace the\naster towards the cell center. These data reveal how mitotic aster\ncentration is coordinated with mitotic entry in chordate zygotes.",

The SELMA3D challenge focuses on self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation. Its objective is to encourage the development of self-supervised learning methods for general segmentation of various structures in 3D light-sheet microscopy images. The dataset comtains 3D image patches of different labeled biological structures in the brain, including blood vessels, c-Fos labeled brain cells involved in neural activity, cell nuclei, and Alzheimer's disease plaques. Each patch includes corresponding pixel-wise annotations for the labeled structures.",

Wild-type fish of the WIK strain and nacre(mitf)w2/w2 were originally obtained from the Zebrafish International Research Center (ZIRC). Crystal zebrafish (nacrew2/w2, albb4/b4, roya9/a9) (Antinucci and Hindges, 2016) were obtained from Dr. Hindges. Fish mutant for scn1lab (Baraban et al., 2013; Grone et al., 2017) were obtained from Dr. Scott Baraban. Fish transgenic for TgBAC[gad1b: loxP-DsRed-loxP-GFP] (Satou et al., 2013) were obtained from Dr.Shin-ichi Higashijima. Fish transgenic for Tg[elavl3:GCaMP5g] (Ahrens et al., 2013a; Ahrens et al., 2013b) were obtained from Dr. Ahrens. Zebrafish mutant for gad1a or gad1b were generated as previously described (VanLeuven et al., 2018; O'Connor et al., 2019). All adult fish were maintained in an Aquatic Habitats (Apopka, FL) multi-rack system. Habitat water consisted of reverse osmosis filtered/sterilized water to which sodium bicarbonate and other salts (Instant Ocean, Aquarium Systems, Inc., Mentor, OH, USA) were added to maintain pH from 7.0-7.4 and conductivity between 400 and 430 \u00b5S. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for use of zebrafish in research under protocols approved and overseen by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee."

For the leaf length, a line was drawn centrally from the leaf base to the leaf tip. The leaf width is a line orthogonal to the leaf length at the height of the first half of the leaf. For the leaf area, the images of the entire leaf were segmented in the Labkit plugin. The resulting classifier and the mask were saved separately. The segmented image was then opened in ImageJ/Fiji and edited if necessary. Editing involved removing excess objects that interfered with the measurement or extended leaf veins that were pulled out of the stem, for example in the segmentations of the species Bryum sp. Finally, the segmentations were saved and measured using the \u201cMagic Wand\u201d tool and the measurement method included in ImageJ/Fiji. The scale of the original image was previously set to \u201cGlobal\u201d in the settings so that the segmentation corresponds to the same scale. Overlapping leaf areas or obviously missing areas, e.g. broken leaf parts, were then marked and measured in the original image using a polygon selection. The resulting values were then added together in the final data table. The cell images were measured without additional segmentation. From each of the three images, a random cell was measured from the center of the image. Only lamina cells were measured. For the length, the distance between the two farthest ends of a cell was used, while the width was recorded as a line orthogonal to it. The width and height were recorded in the images of the cross sections. Width is determined by a line centered between the two farthest ends of the cross-section, while height is determined by measuring individual cells along a line orthogonal to the width of the cross-section. For plants that have a midrib in their leaves, the width and height of the midrib could also be measured. The width was measured using a central line between the two furthest points of the midrib. The height was determined using a central line orthogonal to the width of the midrib. For the species Grimmia pulvinata, the length of the glass hair was also measured. For this purpose, a line was drawn from the base of the glass hair to the tip and measured.\n\n(*translated with DeepL)"

For further details, please see (Lye et al., 2024, PMID: 38683880).  Here we are providing the raw data and relevant annotations for the movies analysed in our publication:\n \n1. Raw movies. We are providing 10 zip files containing the Volocity files (.mvd2 movie files plus associated metadata) for the 4 WT and 6 twist movies analysed in our study. Please note that the movies are not all oriented with the \u2018anterior to the left\u2019 convention, but it is possible to tell anterior from posterior using the direction of tissue extension.\n \n2. Cell type information. We focused our analysis on the ectodermal cells by excluding any mesodermal and mesectodermal cells in the field of view, using several criteria (see Lye et al., 2024, PMID: 38683880). We are providing the information about cell types in 1 zip file \u2018cell type movies\u2019 containing movies for the 4 WT and 6 twist movies (as .mov files and also .tiff files), in which ectodermal cells are labelled in magenta and meso/mesectoderm are labelled in cyan.\n \n3. Movie synchronisation information. In our paper, we analysed data from 15 minutes before, to 30 minutes after, the start of germband extension (-15 mins to 30 mins of GBE).  Note that raw movie files also contain movie frames before and after this time period.  We provide in an Excel spreadsheet called 'Synchronisation information', the frame number that corresponds to 0 mins of GBE for each of the 4 WT and 6 twist movies. Note that in the raw Volocity movie files, frame numbering starts at 1, while in the processed movies in our in-house software 'otracks', frame numbering starts at zero, so there is a difference of 1 in the frame number corresponding to time zero of GBE in the raw movie files (1.) and the 'cell types\" movie files in 'otracks' (2.). This is indicated in the spreadsheet provided.",

        "title": "ATUM-Tomo: A multi-scale approach to cellular ultrastructure by combined volume scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography ",
        "release_date": "2024-08-15",
        "description": "Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, Automated Tape Collecting Ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy. However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed \u2018ATUM-Tomo\u2019, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films. ATUM-SEM of serial semi-thick sections and consecutive ET of selected re-mounted sections combines SEM\u2019s fast target recognition and coarse rendering capability with high-resolution volume visualizations, respectively, thus enabling multi-scale interrogation of cellular ultrastructure. As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Microthrombi and associated sites of BBB leakiness were identified by confocal imaging of injected fluorescent and electron-dense nanoparticles, then relocalized by ATUM-SEM, and finally interrogated by correlative ATUM-Tomo. This workflow is a seamless zoom-in on structural BBB pathology from the micro- to the nanometer scale. Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures.",

Colloidal gold particles (diameter 20 nm, BBI) serving as fiducials for tomographic reconstruction were then attached to the sections by submerging the grids into a droplet of the pure colloidal gold solution for 1 min. Samples were blotted to remove residual solution and air-dried. Semi-thick sections were imaged using a Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV and equipped with a 4k\u00d74k CMOS camera (OneView, Gatan) as previously described (Kiewisz et al., 2022). Using a dual-axis specimen holder (Type 2040, Fishione, USA), tilt series were recorded from -60\u00b0 to +60\u00b0 with 1\u00b0 increments at a magnification of 4700x and a pixel size of 2.572 nm applying the SerialEM software package (Mastronarde, 2003; Mastronarde, 2005). For dual-tilt electron tomography, the grid was rotated for 90\u00b0 in the XY-plane and the second tilt series was acquired using identical microscope settings (Mastronarde, 1997). Both tomographic image stacks of the same positions were reconstructed, combined and flattened using IMOD (Kremer, Mastronarde and McIntosh, 1996; Mastronarde and Held, 2017). Serial semi-thick sections were stitched and combined by using the ZIB Amira (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany) software package (Stalling, Westerhoff and Hege, 2005; Lindow et al., 2021). After converting the image data into TIFF format, the image registration was manually refined in Fiji TrakEM2., followed by a final elastic alignment. Segmentation of cellular features was performed manually with the program VAST (Berger, Seung and Lichtman, 2018) and subsequently rendered in Blender (Brito, 2018). All movies were generated using Amira.",

Hierarchical imaging captures large areas at low resolution that can, in turn, be screened for structures of interest that are subsequently reimaged at higher resolution and so forth. In ATLAS5 Array Tomography (Fibics), wafer overview images were generated (1000 nm/pixel). We acquired whole section low resolution images (0.1\u00d70.1\u00d71 \u00b5m) of every 10th section (thus simulating the thickness of one confocal plane covering 1 \u00b5m thickness) to generate overviews that can be correlated with the confocal imaging data. We used blood vessel patterns, bleedings and the different tissue layers as landmarks. Target regions were identified and acquired at medium resolution (20\u00d720\u00d7200 nm). Within this volume, clots were selected for high-resolution imaging (4-20\u00d74-20\u00d7200 nm). \nFor ATUM-Tomo, electron micrographs were acquired in a similar hierarchical scheme on an Apreo S2 SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the T1 detector. Serial-section acquisition was performed using the Maps2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) software. We acquired images of whole sections at low resolution (100\u00d7100\u00d7400 nm) to facilitate re-location. Anatomical landmarks and vasculature patterns of single SEM overview images and a summed (in Fiji) stack of sections were compared to the confocal data sets in Fiji. Within this volume, we selected a region with clots and transition zones and extravasation for high-resolution imaging at 20\u00d720\u00d7400 nm.

        "description": "Preventing parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes is recognised to be critical for achieving elimination and eradication of malaria. Consequently developing new antimalarial drugs with transmission-blocking properties is a priority. Large screening campaigns have identified many new transmission-blocking molecules, however little is known about how they target transmissible Plasmodium falciparum stage V gametocytes, or how they affect their underlying cell biology. To respond to this knowledge gap, we have developed a machine learning image analysis pipeline to characterise and compare the cellular phenotypes generated by transmission-blocking molecules during male gametogenesis. Using this approach, we studied 40 molecules, categorising their activity based upon timing of action and visual effects on the organisation of tubulin and DNA in the cell. Our data both proposes new modes of action and corroborates existing modes of action of identified transmission-blocking molecules. Furthermore, the characterised molecules provide a new armoury of tool compounds to probe gametocyte cell biology and the generated imaging dataset provides a new reference for researchers to correlate molecular target or gene deletion to specific cellular phenotype. Our analysis pipeline is not optimised for a specific organism and could be applied to any fluorescence microscopy dataset containing cells delineated by bounding boxes, and so is extendible to any disease model.",

For each sample, tubulin-postive, DAPI-positive stained gametocytes/gametes were imaged at random. Z-stack images with 0.3\u00b5m slices were captured for each field of view and images deconvolved and transformed by maximum intensity projection within the Nikon NIS Elements software. All images were background corrected using an automated processing pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis. To do this, a region of interest (ROI) containing no cells was manually drawn on all images and then the pipeline subtracted the mean fluorescence of the ROI in each fluorescence channel from the image. Afterwards, cells were initially identified by an automated analysis pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis based upon the intensity of the tubulin staining captured which assigns a region of interest (ROI) around each cell. All ROIs were reviewed by a trained operator and adjusted if necessary to reflect the true outline of the cell (for example if two cells touching had been allocated the same ROI).\nAll images with identified cells were then analysed as complete datasets within our developed PhIDDLI analysis pipeline which uses machine learning to cluster individual cells by phenotype and visualise the result either in tabulated form or an interactive tSNE plot.\n"

Gametocytes were induced by seeding culture flasks at 2% parasitaemia/4% haematocrit and subjecting them to daily medium changes for 14 days whilst maintaining a temperature of 37\u00b0C at all times. On Day 14, the maturity of gametocytes was assessed by quantifying male gametogenesis (exflagellation). A 20 \u00b5l sample of gametocyte culture was mixed with equal volume of ookinete medium (complete culture medium supplemented with 0.1 \u00b5M xanthurenic acid) at room temperature and transferred to a haemocytometer. After 20 min at room temperature, exflagellation was accurately quantified as described in Delves et al. 2016. Cultures possessing >0.2% exflagellation (including uninfected erythrocytes) were selected for downstream assays.\n\nMature gametocyte cultures were divided into 100 \u00b5l \u201cmicrocultures\u201d in pre-warmed 1.5 ml tubes also containing 100 \u00b5l complete culture medium with test compounds at a final concentration of 10xIC50 or 0.5% DMSO as a solvent control. Tubes were gassed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. The entire compound library was screened once, spread over four different experiments, each with two DMSO control tubes. An 8% formaldehyde solution was prepared by diluting 16% methanol-free formaldehyde in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In each experiment, one DMSO control tube was fixed with equal volume of 8% formaldehyde (4% final concentration) at 37 \u00b0C to provide an \u201cunactivated\u201d gametocyte control. Gametogenesis was then triggered in the remaining DMSO control tube and all compound tubes by adding 10 \u00b5l ookinete medium, and they were immediately incubated at room temperature. After 20 min (when exflagellation is maximal), all remaining tubes were fixed for 30 min."

Z-stack images with 0.3\u00b5m slices were captured for each field of view and images deconvolved and transformed by maximum intensity projection within the Nikon NIS Elements software. All images were background corrected using an automated processing pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis. To do this, a region of interest (ROI) containing no cells was manually drawn on all images and then the pipeline subtracted the mean fluorescence of the ROI in each fluorescence channel from the image. Afterwards, cells were initially identified by an automated analysis pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis based upon the intensity of the tubulin staining captured which assigns a region of interest (ROI) around each cell. All ROIs were reviewed by a trained operator and adjusted if necessary to reflect the true outline of the cell (for example if two cells touching had been allocated the same ROI).\nAll images with identified cells were then analysed as complete datasets within our developed PhIDDLI analysis pipeline which uses machine learning to cluster individual cells by phenotype and visualise the result either in tabulated form or an interactive tSNE plot.\n"

Gametocytes were induced by seeding culture flasks at 2% parasitaemia/4% haematocrit and subjecting them to daily medium changes for 14 days whilst maintaining a temperature of 37\u00b0C at all times. On Day 14, the maturity of gametocytes was assessed by quantifying male gametogenesis (exflagellation). A 20 \u00b5l sample of gametocyte culture was mixed with equal volume of ookinete medium (complete culture medium supplemented with 0.1 \u00b5M xanthurenic acid) at room temperature and transferred to a haemocytometer. After 20 min at room temperature, exflagellation was accurately quantified as described in Delves et al. 2016.

Tubes were gassed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. The entire compound library was screened once, spread over four different experiments, each with two DMSO control tubes. An 8% formaldehyde solution was prepared by diluting 16% methanol-free formaldehyde in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In each experiment, one DMSO control tube was fixed with equal volume of 8% formaldehyde (4% final concentration) at 37 \u00b0C to provide an \u201cunactivated\u201d gametocyte control. Gametogenesis was then triggered in the remaining DMSO control tube and all compound tubes by adding 10 \u00b5l ookinete medium, and they were immediately incubated at room temperature. After 20 min (when exflagellation is maximal), all remaining tubes were fixed for 30 min."

Reconstructions of super-resolution images were performed using ThunderSTORM (Ovesny et al., 2016). To validate the quality of the SMLM reconstructions by quantitative error mapping of super-resolution images we used the NanoJ-SQUIRREL package (Culley et al., 2018; Schindelin et al., 2012) in FIJI. For Fourier ring correlation (FRC) analysis, 20 000 images from the time series were split into odd and even frames, which were used to reconstruct super-resolution images in ThunderSTORM. Images were then merged into a stack in FIJI and used as the input for the FRC analysis in NanoJ-SQUIRREL. Density-based cluster analysis was performed in the SMAP environment (Ries, 2020). For the clustering analysis, the super-resolution reconstructions were first processed by the density calculator (counting neighbours for each localization in a circle < 12 nm), which was then used to filter out localizations in lowest-density regions. Subsequently, we calculated the number of clusters using DBscan, using the SMAP implementation of the algorithm by Caetano et al., 2015; with the minimum number of objects in the neighbourhood set to 7; the neighbouring radius set to 20. 3D surface projections were rendered using the Imaris software (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments)."

        "description": "Hepatocytes form bile canaliculi that dynamically respond to the signalling activity of bile acids and bile flow. Little is known about their responses to intraluminal pressure. During embryonic development, hepatocytes assemble apical bulkheads that increase the canalicular resistance to intraluminal pressure. Here, we investigated if they may also protect bile canaliculi against elevated pressure upon impaired bile flow in adult liver. Apical bulkheads accumulate upon bile flow obstruction in mouse models and patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Their loss under these conditions leads to abnormally dilated canaliculi, resembling liver cell rosettes described in other hepatic diseases. 3D reconstruction revealed that these structures are sections of cysts and tubes formed by hepatocytes. Mathematical modelling established that they positively correlate with canalicular pressure and occur early in PSC. Using primary hepatocytes and 3D organoids, we demonstrated that excessive canalicular pressure causes the loss of apical bulkheads and formation of rosettes. Our results suggest that apical bulkheads are a protective mechanism of hepatocytes against impaired bile flow, highlighting the role of canalicular pressure in liver diseases.",

        "description": "Cell fragmentation is commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and is associated with poor prognosis during assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. However, the mechanisms leading to cell fragmentation remain largely unknown. Here, light sheet microscopy imaging of mouse embryos reveals that inefficient chromosome separation due to spindle defects, caused by dysfunctional molecular motors Myo1c or dynein, leads to fragmentation during mitosis. Extended exposure of the cell cortex to chromosomes locally triggers actomyosin contractility and pinches off cell fragments. This process is reminiscent of meiosis, during which small GTPase-mediated signals from chromosomes coordinate polar body extrusion (PBE) by actomyosin contraction. By interfering with the signals driving PBE, we find that this meiotic signaling pathway remains active during cleavage stages and is both required and sufficient to trigger fragmentation. Together, we find that fragmentation happens in mitosis after ectopic activation of actomyosin contractility by signals emanating from DNA, similar to those observed during meiosis. Our study uncovers the mechanisms underlying fragmentation in preimplantation embryos and, more generally, offers insight into the regulation of mitosis during the maternal-zygotic transition.",

A segmented line is used to define the size and the location of the LifeAct or Myh9-GFP cap. Starting at the first division timepoint the intensity is measured at the segmented line, with the length of the eventually formed cap, and the distance between the center of the DNA mass and the center of the segmented line. The intensity of another segmented line drawn with the same length on a different part of the cell-medium interface where no cortical fluctuations are observed is used to normalize the intensity. \n\nSpindle analysis\nSpindle persistence was calculated by measuring the time between the appearance and disappearance of the spindle. Spindle straightness was measured using FIJI by dividing the length of a straight line connecting spindle poles divided by the length of a broken line drawn along the spindle. For spindle rotation, the angle between the initial direction of one spindle pole and its maximal change of direction was measured.\n\nNuclear envelope reassembly\nThe time between nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly was measured based on the first time point where the nuclear envelope is not visible anymore until the time point where the nuclear envelope reappears. Cells from the same embryos are averaged together.\n\nStatistics \nData are plotted using GraphPad Prism. Statistical tests are performed using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10-2. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample that survived the experiment, as assessed by the continuation of cell divisions, was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments. \n"

In brief, the organisms were introduced in a rectangular microfluidic chip (length 2.2cm, width 1cm, height 150\u03bcm) of glass slides with copper side walls which act as electrodes. A high speed camera (Phantom V1210 camera, 10000fps) mounted to the microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2, 40X DIC objective) and an electrophysiological DC pulse generator (Grass instruments, S88) were synchronized with a micro-controller (Arduino Uno). Pulse voltage and duration were chosen according to previously reported results.\n\n- Transmission Electron Microscopy\nSpirostomum ambiguum were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PHEM buffer for at least one hour at room temperature. The samples were stained with Safranin-O and stabilized in 1% low melting point agarose, then cut into 1mm cubes. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, room temperature (RT)) in 1X PBS, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 1xPBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, RT) in buffer and then briefly in distilled water. Samples were then subjected to an ascending acetone gradient (10min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%) followed by pure acetone (2\u00d7; 10 min, RT). Samples were progressively infiltrated with Epon resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), while rocking, and then polymerized at 60\u2103 for 24-48 hours in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), collected on glass slides and used for general orientation. Thin sections (70-80 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. Thin sections were\npost-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate, 5 mins each. Then sections were either imaged using a Tecnai 12 120kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) at UC Berkeley, or imaged in the JEOL JEM-1400 120kV with photo taken using a Gatan Orius 2k X 2k digital camera at Stanford University. The montage image was created by SerialEM. All segmentation of organelles was done manually on Fiji.\n\n- Confocal Imaging\nSpirostomum ambiguum were stained alive in 625ng/mL DiOC6(3) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #318426-250MG) and 500nM MitoTracker\u2122 Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #M7510) for 30 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

        "release_date": "2023-06-30",
        "description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival rarely exceeding 2 years. Tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment are key factors contributing to the poor response rates of current therapeutic approaches. GBM-associated macrophages (GAMs) often exhibit immunosuppressive features that promote tumor progression. However, their dynamic interactions with GBM tumor cells remain poorly understood. Here, we used patient-derived GBM stem cell cultures and combined single-cell RNA sequencing of GAM-GBM co-cultures and real-time in vivo monitoring of GAM-GBM interactions in orthotopic zebrafish xenograft models to provide insight into the cellular, molecular, and spatial heterogeneity. Our analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across GBM patients in GBM-induced GAM polarization and the ability to attract and activate GAMs \u2013 features that correlated with patient survival. Differential gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry on original tumor samples, and knock-out experiments in zebrafish subsequently identified LGALS1 as a primary regulator of immunosuppression. Overall, our work highlights that GAM-GBM interactions can be studied in a clinically relevant way using co-cultures and avatar models, while offering new opportunities to identify promising immune-modulating targets.",

At 30 hpf, GFP-expressing GBM tumor cells were microinjected into the hindbrain ventricle of anesthetized (0.014% tricaine, MS-222, Sigma-Aldrich) Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF)ump2; Tg(kdrl:lynEYFP)  embryos. Approximately 300-800 cells were injected per embryo and zebrafish avatars were grown at 34\u00b0C until the end of the experiment. At 1 dpi (54 hpf), zebrafish avatars were screened for the presence of GBM cells and those with the largest tumors were selected for overnight imaging. At 5 dpi (144 hpf), the same avatars were imaged again to follow tumor progression. ",

Computational methods for image-based profiling are under active development, but their success hinges on assays that can capture a wide range of phenotypes. We have developed a multiplex cytological profiling assay that \"paints the cell\" with as many fluorescent markers as possible without compromising our ability to extract rich, quantitative profiles in high throughput. The assay detects seven major cellular components. In a pilot screen of bioactive compounds, the assay detected a range of cellular phenotypes and it clustered compounds with similar annotated protein targets or chemical structure based on cytological profiles. The results demonstrate that the assay captures subtle patterns in the combination of morphological labels, thereby detecting the effects of chemical compounds even though their targets are not stained directly. This image-based assay provides an unbiased approach to characterize compound- and disease-associated cell states to support future probe discovery.

This pilot experiment consists of 20 plates. Each plate has 384 wells and each well has 9 fields of view for a total of 69,120 fields of view. Each field was imaged in five channels (detection wavelengths), and each channel is stored as a separate, grayscale image file, so there are 345,600 image files in 16-bit TIFF format. The plates in this screen were originally included as part of idr0016/screenA but were moved to idr0036/screenA in August 2017 to make it clearer that they correspond to the Broad BioImaging Benchmark Collection dataset BBBC022 (https://www.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC022/).\"",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0026.  Cancer immunotherapy is undergoing significant progress due to recent clinical successes by refined adoptive T-cell transfer and immunostimulatory monoclonal Ab (mAbs). B16F10-derived OVA-expressing mouse melanomas resist curative immunotherapy with either adoptive transfer of activated anti-OVA OT1 CTLs or agonist anti-CD137 (4-1BB) mAb. However, when acting in synergistic combination, these treatments consistently achieve tumor eradication. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that accomplish tumor rejection exhibit enhanced effector functions in both transferred OT-1 and endogenous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This is consistent with higher levels of expression of eomesodermin in transferred and endogenous CTLs and with intravital live-cell two-photon microscopy evidence for more efficacious CTL-mediated tumor cell killing. Anti-CD137 mAb treatment resulted in prolonged intratumor persistence of the OT1 CTL-effector cells and improved function with focused and confined interaction kinetics of OT-1 CTL with target cells and increased apoptosis induction lasting up to six days postadoptive transfer. The synergy of adoptive T-cell therapy and agonist anti-CD137 mAb thus results from in vivo enhancement and sustainment of effector functions.",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0090.  Drug resistance threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of human infections. This highlights an urgent need for new and improved drugs with novel mechanisms of action to avoid cross-resistance. Current cell-based drug screens are, however, restricted to binary live/dead readouts with no provision for mechanism of action prediction. Machine learning methods are increasingly being used to improve information extraction from imaging data. Such methods, however, work poorly with heterogeneous cellular phenotypes and generally require time-consuming human-led training. We have developed a semi-supervised machine learning approach, combining human- and machine-labelled training data from mixed human malaria parasite cultures. Designed for high-throughput and high-resolution screening, our semi-supervised approach is robust to natural parasite morphological heterogeneity and correctly orders parasite developmental stages. Our approach also reproducibly detects and clusters drug-induced morphological outliers by mechanism of action, demonstrating the potential power of machine learning for accelerating cell-based drug discovery.",

For the membrane model, preliminary segmentations of cell boundaries were initially generated using the lamin B1 workflow from the Segmenter. The \u201cCurator\u201d tool from the Segmenter was used to mask out areas of the images that were not segmented accurately. The original membrane model was trained on a dataset of 14 neuromasts labeled with Tg(-8.0cldnb:LY-EGFP). The membrane model predictions were thresholded and used as input for an interactive distance transform watershed segmentation workflow. Upon generating the label images, the find_boundaries function from scikit-image was used to generate watershed lines, which was used as input to train a second membrane model with improved performance. This process was repeated once more with a new dataset of 9 Tg(-8.0cldnb:LY-EGFP) neuromasts stained with DRAQ5, except labeled nuclei were used to generate seeds for the watershed instead of the distance transform. The results were used to train the third membrane model, which was used for instance segmentation (delineation of individual objects) of all the images in this study.\n\tTo generate the nucleus mask model, the \u201cH2B coarse\u201d model provided by AICS22 was used to generate preliminary nucleus predictions. The predictions were thresholded, and the membrane intensity image (or membrane boundary predictions) were used to \u201csplit\u201d the nuclei (as described in \u201cInstance segmentation\u201d). Similar to the refinement for the membrane model, a distance transform watershed workflow was applied to thresholded nuclei predictions to generate labeled nuclei, which were converted to binary masks and used to train the first nucleus mask model. This process was repeated (starting from the model 1 predictions instead of the H2B coarse model predictions) to generate a second nucleus mask model with improved performance, which was used for all the images in this study.\n"

        "description": "The shaping of human embryos begins with compaction, during which cells come into close contact. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) studies suggest that human embryos fail compaction primarily because of defective adhesion. Based on our current understanding of animal morphogenesis, other morphogenetic engines, such as cell contractility, could be involved in shaping human embryos. However, the molecular, cellular and physical mechanisms driving human embryo morphogenesis remain uncharacterized. Using micropipette aspiration on human embryos donated to research, we have mapped cell surface tensions during compaction. This reveals a 4-fold increase of tension at the cell-medium interface while cell-cell contacts keep a steady tension. Therefore, increased tension at the cell-medium interface drives human embryo compaction, which is qualitatively similar to compaction in mouse embryos. Further comparison between human and mouse reveals qualitatively similar but quantitively different mechanical strategies, with human embryos being mechanically least efficient. Inhibition of cell contractility and cell-cell adhesion in human embryos reveals that, while both cellular processes are required for compaction, only contractility controls the surface tensions responsible for compaction. Interestingly, cell contractility and cell-cell adhesion exhibit distinct mechanical signatures when faulty. Analyzing the mechanical signature of naturally failing embryos, we find evidence that non-compacting or partially compacting embryos containing excluded cells have defective contractility. Together, our study reveals that an evolutionarily conserved increase in cell contractility is required to generate the forces driving the first morphogenetic movement shaping the human body.",

In brief, the equatorial plane of the object is taken to manually draw a line between the inner walls of the pipette or a circle fitting the cell-medium interface of cells. To measure external contact angles, two line segments are drawn tangentially to the cell-medium interfaces of two contacting cells with their intersection located at the cell-cell contact edge (Fig 1a). Similarly, to measure internal contact angles, two line segments are drawn: one along the cell-cell contact and another tangentially to the cell-medium interface of one of the contacting cells (Fig 1a). As an internal control of the measurement, we verify that the three angles roughly sum up to 360\u00b0 (with a tolerance of 10\u00b0).\nTo measure cortical intensity, as done previously7, we picked confocal slices cutting through the equatorial plane of two contacting cells using Fiji. We drew a 1 \u03bcm thick line along the cell-medium interface or cell-cell contact, measured the mean intensity and divided the contact intensity by the sum of the cell-medium intensities of contacting cells.\nTo measure the volume of cells, we use Bitplane Imaris to draw the contour of cells along the F-actin signal on confocal slices of stained embryos, as done previously7.\n"

The \u2018Image Calculator\u2019 Imaris XTension was used to create a channel that was the sum of both HP1-alpha-GFP and the SNAP-tagged DNMT3B and the resultant channel was used to create a 3D isosurface representing the whole nucleus. This was done using the additive channel to ensure the whole nucleus was segmented. The Imaris module \u2018Cell\u2019 was then used to relate the segmented heterochromatin to the nucleus it was inside. This meant a ratio of the mean intensity of DNMT3B signal in the heterochromatic regions over the mean intensity in the rest of the nucleus could be obtained."

Cell movements were corrected by registering (through roto-traslations) all frames with the starting one using the TurboReg plugin in Fiji (Thevenaz et al., 1998). The mean intensity of the bleaching region I^B (t), as well as that of the entire nucleus I^C (t) was measured. A first normalisation was performed to correct the photobleaching of the signal in time and to normalise the signal in the range [0,1], where 1 corresponds to the normalised pre-bleaching signal:\n\nI^N (t)=(I^B (t)/I^C (t))/(I_pre^B (t)/I_pre^C (t) )\n\nwhere I_pre^B (t) and I_pre^C (t) are respectively the average pre-bleach signal in the bleached region and in the entire nucleus.\n\tA second normalisation was performed to shift the minimum intensity of the signal to 0, while maintaining the signal in the range of 0 to 1. This is necessary for visually comparing FRAP curves for different conditions, as they typically have different minima in the intensity (bleaching is not 100% efficient). This second normalisation does not influence the fitting of the curves. The new normalised intensity is therefore:\n\nI^N2 (t)=(I^N (t)-I_min^N)/(1-I_min^N )\n\nBeing I_min^N the minimum intensity of the FRAP curve.\nFor every FRAP recovery curve, we calculated the fraction of the immobile (or very slow) population, defined as IF=1-I^N2 (t=+\u221e). In our case we approximated I^N2 (t=+\u221e) as the average of the last 50 values of I^N2 (i.e., from t=100s to t=150s). The FRAP recovery curves and immobile fraction were calculated for every experiment, as well as their standard deviation.  Data shown in Fig. 6e are obtained from the mean of the 3 biological repeats (experiment 1: WT n=3, \u2206N n=6; experiment 2: WT n=5, \u2206N n=15; experiment 3: WT n=10, \u2206N n=7). Standard deviation has been calculated using the theory of errors propagation for uncorrelated data."

        "description": "Pooled genetic screens are powerful tools to study gene function in a high-throughput manner. Typically, sequencing-based screens require cell lysis, which limits the examination of critical phenotypes such as cell morphology, protein subcellular localization, and cell-cell/tissue interactions. In contrast, emerging optical pooled screening methods enable the investigation of these spatial phenotypes in response to targeted CRISPR perturbations. In this study, we report a multi-omic optical pooled CRISPR screening method, which we have named CRISPRmap. Our method combines a novel in situ CRISPR guide identifying barcode readout approach with concurrent multiplexed immunofluorescence and in situ RNA detection. CRISPRmap barcodes are detected and read out through combinatorial hybridization of DNA oligos, enhancing barcode detection efficiency, while reducing both dependency on third party proprietary sequencing reagents and assay cost. Notably, we conducted a multi-omic base-editing screen in a breast cancer cell line on core DNA damage repair genes involved in the homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways investigating how nucleotide variants in those genes influence DNA damage signaling and cell cycle regulation following treatment with ionizing radiation or DNA damaging agents commonly used for cancer therapy. Approximately a million cells were profiled with our multi-omic approach,\nproviding a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of the functional consequences of the studied variants. CRISPRmap enabled us to pinpoint likely-pathogenic patient-derived mutations that were previously classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore, our approach effectively distinguished barcodes of a pooled library in tumor tissue, and we coupled it with cell-type and molecular phenotyping by cyclic immunofluorescence. Multi-omic spatial analysis of how CRISPR-perturbed cells respond to various environmental cues in the tissue context offers the potential to significantly expand our understanding of tissue biology in both health and disease.",

        "description": "Morphological modifications and shifts in organelle relationships are hallmarks of dormancy in eukaryotic cells. Communications between altered mitochondria and nuclei are associated with metabolic quiescence of cancer cells that can survive chemotherapy. In plants, changes in the pathways between nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are associated with cold stress and bud dormancy. Plasmodium falciparum parasites, the deadliest agent of malaria in humans, contain a chloroplast-like organelle (apicoplast) derived from an ancient photosynthetic symbiont. Antimalarial treatments can fail because a small fraction of the blood stage parasites enter dormancy and recrudesce after drug exposure. Altered mitochondrial-nuclear interactions in these persisters have been described for P. falciparum, but interactions of the apicoplast remained to be characterized. In the present study, we examined the apicoplasts of dormant persisters obtained after exposure to dihydroartemisinin (a first-line antimalarial drug) followed by sorbitol treatment, or after exposure to sorbitol treatment alone. As previously observed, the mitochondrion of persisters was consistently enlarged and in close association with the nucleus. In contrast, the apicoplast varied from compact and oblate, like those of active ring stage parasites, to enlarged and irregularly shaped. Enlarged apicoplasts became more prevalent later in dormancy, but regular size apicoplasts subsequently predominated when actively replicating parasites recrudesced. All three organelles, nucleus, mitochondrion, and apicoplast, became closer during dormancy. Understanding their relationships in erythrocytic-stage persisters may lead to new strategies to prevent recrudescences and protect the future of malaria chemotherapy.",

        "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0064.  Complex, time-varying responses have been observed widely in cell signaling, but how specific dynamics are generated or regulated is largely unknown. One major obstacle has been that high-throughput screens for identifying pathway components are typically incompatible with the live-cell assays used to monitor dynamics. Here, we address this challenge by performing a drug screen for altered Erk signaling dynamics in primary mouse keratinocytes. We screened a library of 429 kinase inhibitors, monitoring Erk activity over 5 h in more than 80,000 single live cells. The screen revealed both known and uncharacterized modulators of Erk dynamics, including inhibitors of non-EGFR receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that increased Erk pulse frequency and overall activity. Using drug treatment and direct optogenetic control, we demonstrate that drug-induced changes to Erk dynamics alter the conditions under which cells proliferate. Our work opens the door to high-throughput screens using live-cell biosensors and reveals that cell proliferation integrates information from Erk dynamics as well as additional permissive cues.",

                        "features_analysed": "Our analysis pipeline takes as input a two-color, multi-timepoint TIFF stack that includes two fluorescent channels - KTR-BFP and H2B-RFP - for monitoring Erk activity and tracking/segmenting nuclei. These TIFF images contained metadata including the spatial scale of the data, and since our analysis pipeline incorporates true spatial units (?m rather than pixels), it can be used for images collected with any objective magnification. We first used a FIJI Jython script batch_trackmate.py to automatically run the TrackMate segmentation/tracking plugin on a folder of TIFF stacks, returning the mean nuclear intensity for each cell in both the H2B and KTR channels. Each dataset thus consisted of two paired folders: one containing all the TIFFs (with names <image_name>.tif) and one of the corresponding TrackMate tracks (with names <image_name>.txt). In addition to containing the mean nuclear intensities in all fluorescent channels, the resulting TrackMate tracks also include the X-Y locations of each nucleus at all timepoints, enabling analysis of each cell's overall displacement and velocity. All subsequent analyses were performed in MATLAB. We wrote a set of analysis tools to automatically load the TIFFs and TrackMate tracks from the paired folders and analyze them with a set of options specified in a comma-delimited parameters file that is generated for each dataset. We first exclude TrackMate-tracked nuclei on either of two conditions: (1) they do not express both H2B and KTR, or (2) if H2B intensity changes dramatically over the imaging timecourse, indicating a tracking error. We then filter and process nuclear KTR intensities using the following steps: (1) data is background-subtracted; (2) data is h-minima transformed to 'flatten' noise between consecutive timepoints; (3) data is inverted and scaled assuming that the maximum nuclear KTR intensity observed for each cell corresponds to Erk activity of 0; and (4) data is fed into a peak-finding routine that splits the trajectory into windows containing individual peaks, which are then analyzed using MATLAB's built-in findpeaks.m function. In addition to analysis of single-cell trajectories, we also perform one well-averaged measurement at each timepoint: the overall cytosol-to-nuclear ratio computed for all identified cells. To do so, we used image dilation and erosion operations to obtain an annulus of cytoplasm surrounding all segmented nuclei. We then computed the mean C/N ratio by measuring the mean intensity in all cytosolic pixels divided by the mean intensity of all nuclear pixels. We found this ratio to be an excellent proxy for well-averaged activity; as an example, it is able to accurately detect keratinocytes' graded Erk responses to increasing doses of EGF. We opted for a well-averaged C/N ratio rather than a single-cell ratio primarily because correctly assigning cytosolic regions to the appropriate nucleus can be quite tricky, especially in an epithelial monolayer. At the conclusion of our analysis routine, the user is provided with two data structures: well, which contains the raw and processed nuclear KTR and Erk activity trajectories; and PS, a structure that contains all analyses of Erk dynamics over time (e.g., frequency, pulse prominence, overall Erk activity offset, total distance moved per cell, etc.). These quantities were used for all subsequent analyses. Example runs are available on Github (github.com/toettchlab/Goglia2019)."

        "description": "Matrix assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for various molecules such as small molecule metabolites (SMMs), correlating an analytes mass to charge ratio and its spatial localisation on a tissue surface. Despite the growing interest in this technique, a comprehensive SMM MALDI-imaging gallery is still lacking in literature. Here, we present a Small Molecule Metabolite MALDI imaging gallery, unveiling a comprehensive exploration into the spatial distribution of over 100 metabolites of various pathways and classes sourced from three distinct mouse tissues.",

The imzML file was then loaded into LipostarMSI with specific parameters: 3ppm m/z tolerance, peak intensity >1%, peak detection frequency >1%, and minimum spatial chaos >0.7. Hotspot removal was applied using the 99% quantile, and no denoising was performed. For internal normalization, m/z 121.0444 was utilized for d4-succinic acid.\n\nMSI data was uploaded to LipostarMSI and peak picked and processed using the above parameters. We then checked the image each individually picked ion to assess if it had a reasonable distribution across any on-tissue areas. If a distribution and signal was present, we cross referenced this ion mass with an in-house library of standards and from Metaspace annotations for identification, with a mass error acceptance of 3ppm.

        "description": "During asymmetric cell division, cell polarity is coordinated with the cell cycle to allow proper inheritance of cell fate determinants and generation of cellular diversity. In the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) zygote, polarity is governed by evolutionarily conserved Partitioning (PAR) proteins that segregate to opposing cortical domains to specify asymmetric cell fates. Timely establishment of PAR domains requires a cell cycle kinase, Aurora A (AIR-1 in C. elegans). Aurora A depletion by RNAi causes a spectrum of phenotypes including reversed polarity,  excess posterior domains, and no posterior domain. How depletion of a single kinase can cause seemingly opposite phenotypes remains obscure. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system and drug treatments, we found that AIR-1 regulates polarity differently at different times of the cell cycle. During meiosis I, AIR-1 acts to prevent later formation of bipolar domains, while in meiosis II, AIR-1 is necessary to recruit PAR-2 onto the membrane. Together these data clarify the origin of multiple polarization phenotypes in RNAi experiments and reveal multiple roles of AIR-1 in coordinating PAR protein localization with cell cycle progression.

        "release_date": "2024-01-31",
        "description": "Background  \tFetal growth restriction (FGR) is a pregnancy complication in which a newborn fails to achieve its growth potential, increasing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality.  Chronic maternal gestational hypoxia, as well as placental insufficiency are associated with increased FGR incidence; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying FGR remain unknown. \nMethods  \t Pregnant mice were subjected to acute or chronic hypoxia (12.5% O2) resulting in reduced fetal weight.  Placenta oxygen transport was assessed by blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The placentae were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.  Human placentae were selected from FGR and matched controls and analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Maternal and cord sera were analyzed by mass spectrometry. \nResults\t\tWe show that murine acute and chronic gestational hypoxia recapitulates FGR phenotype and affects placental structure and morphology. Gestational hypoxia decreased labyrinth area, increased the incidence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the labyrinth while expanding the placental spiral arteries (SpA) diameter. Hypoxic placentae exhibited higher hemoglobin-oxygen affinity compared to the control. Placental abundance of Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) was upregulated in the syncytiotrophoblast and spiral artery trophoblast cells (SpA TGCs) in the murine gestational hypoxia groups compared to the control. Hif1a levels were higher in the acute hypoxia group compared to the control. In contrast, human FGR placentae exhibited reduced BPGM levels in the syncytiotrophoblast layer compared to placentae from healthy uncomplicated pregnancies. Levels of 2,3 BPG, the product of BPGM, were lower in cord serum of human FGR placentae compared to control. Polar expression of BPGM, was found in both human and mouse placentae syncytiotrophoblast, with higher expression facing the maternal circulation. Moreover, in the murine SpA TGCs expression of BPGM was concentrated exclusively in the apical cell side, in direct proximity to the maternal circulation. \nConclusions\tThis study suggests a possible involvement of placental BPGM in maternal-fetal oxygen transfer, and in the pathophysiology of FGR.\n",

The animals were positioned to maximize the number of fetuses that could be viewed while still observing maternal liver. The duration of the MRI measurements at each oxygen level was approximately 20 min. After the O2 concentration was reduced, a 2 minute interval was given before acquiring the next set of MRI images, allowing R2* stabilization.  At each oxygen phase, the nitrogen level was adjusted to maintain a constant flow of inhaled gas. To determine R2* values three Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) acquisitions were performed with TE= 1.6 ms, 2.6 ms and 3.6 ms. The parameters for these GRE measurements were as follows: 48 slices with slice thickness of 0.4 mm with 0.1 mm inter-slice gap, field of view 4.2 X 3.3 cm2, pulse flip angle 40\u00b0, matrix size 280 x 220 (150 x 150 um2 pixel size), 2 averages (motion averaging). Images were acquired with fat suppression and RF spoiling. The excitation pulse was 0.5 ms (6400 Hz bandwidth) and the acquisition bandwidth was 200 kHz. The slice order was interleaved. The sequence was respiration triggered (per slice) with an approximate TR of 800 ms.",

        "description": "Redox homeostasis modulates the morphology of cardiomyocytes\nRedox homeostasis is affected in heart failure. Remodelling of heart failure has been associated with enhanced ROS production due to alterations in the excitation-contraction coupling, or due to altered cytoplasmic calcium handling (M\u00fcnzel, Gori et al. 2015). However, these alterations are met by adaptations of the antioxidative system to restore redox homeostasis. We have noted that redox induces changes to cardiomyocytes geometry, where oxidative stress induces cardiomyocytes\u2019 elongation and atrophy, while antioxidative compounds promotes cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. These alterations in the cardiomyocyte\u2019s geometry resemble the changes observed to geometry of the heart during heart failure and indicate that intracellular redox homeostasis is involved in regulating the morphology of cardiomyocytes. We quantitatively measured these alterations in cell morphology upon treating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with a pro-oxidant (Sulforaphane, SF) and an antioxidant (N-Acetyl Cysteine, NAC). We utilized florescence microscopic imaging, followed by image analysis with ImageJ. This experiment is part of a study that investigates the impact of endogenous antioxidative defenses in the heart and the potentially adverse effects associated with excessive quenching of physiological levels of reactive oxygen species, which act as cellular signalling molecules. The study is now available as a pre-pint on BioRxiv (Epigenetic modulators link mitochondrial redox homeostasis to cardiac function a sex-dependent manner, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.26.485908), and under consideration for publication in Nature Communications.",

In short, we developed an unbiased approach to profile the shape of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in Fiji 60. The \u03b1-actinin channel was utilized for segmentation. The workflow consisted of a pre-processing step in which the median filter was applied to the input images in order to reduce noise. Then, the images were segmented using the Li\u2019s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method. To avoid any bias in quantifying segmented cardiomyocytes between different treatments, we excluded all cropped cells that were on the images\u2019 edges. We also excluded segmented particles with an area smaller than 50000 pixels.\nTo quantify the changes in cell shape upon treatments, we utilized the minimum caliper diameter (MinFeret shape descriptor in Fiji), which measures the smallest diameter between any two points at the boundary of a segmented object. We also utilized the area of the segmented objects to visualize changes in cardiomyocytes\u2019 size upon different treatments. However, NRCMs in 2D culture acquire a variety of random shapes and sizes, and the diversity in the shapes and sizes were further greatly enhanced by the SF and NAC treatments, which also affected the identifications of contiguous cells\u2019 boundaries. This fact made it impossible to segment all individual cardiomyocytes, especially in the NAC treatment, where cells were hypertrophied and more intertwined. This problem was not even possible to resolve by manual curation of cells\u2019 borders or by staining the cytoplasmic membrane. As our interest was to quantify the changes in cell area and diameter between different treatments, we segmented connected cells as one object. We segmented 6 images from the control group, and 8 images from each of SF and NAC treatments. The segmentation resulted in 123-196 objects per image. For each object of each image, we computed the area and minimum diameter. To plot them, we pooled the measures of each condition together. Pooling them resulted in groups of values, in which each value originated from one image (6 for the control condition,8 for NAC and 8 for SF treatments). Then we calculated the average of each group. This resulted in 148 objects in the control condition, 144 objects in the NAC treatment, and 196 objects in the SF treatment as shown in the Source Data File. These averaged values of the segmented objects\u2019 area and MinFeret were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The implemented image analysis pipeline is available in Github (https://github.com/BIIFSweden/CellGeometryProfiling)."

The same settings were used for all the samples to be compared.\nThe brightness and contrast of the analyzed images were adjusted to the same settings, and the images were acquired either in widefield as tiles (9x9).\n",

        "description": "Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta's heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the \u2018Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY\u2019 (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY\u2019s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature.",

        "description": "Fast, accurate and affordable bacterial identification methods are paramount for timely treatment of infections, especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). However, today only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach by the acquisition and the subsequent analysis comprising 257 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and inter- species variability, a scenario more akin to the real-world clinical practice rather than the one achievable solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite the variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7 %. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.",

                "description": "Fast, accurate and affordable bacterial identification methods are paramount for timely treatment of infections, especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). However, today only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach by the acquisition and the subsequent analysis comprising 252 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and inter- species variability, a scenario more akin to the real-world clinical practice rather than the one achievable solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite the variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7 %. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.",

Briefly, for all the channels (KC, LSEC, GFP+ and nuclei) we extract black and white masks of the cells/nuclei by background subtraction and then applying a fixed threshold. A mask of the tissue is obtained similarly on the image calculated as max projection across all the channels. Then combining with logical operations the masks of the different cell kinds and the tissue, we are able to estimate the fraction of area occupied by the different cell types as well as the fraction of GFP positive cells within each population."

        "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication form between bacteria via small signal molecules that enables global gene regulation as a function of cell density. We applied a microfluidic mother machine to study the kinetics of the QS response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to additions and withdrawals of signal molecules. We traced the fast buildup and the subsequent considerably slower decay of a population-level and single-cell-level QS response. We applied a mathematical model to explain the results quantitatively. We found significant heterogeneity in QS on the single-cell level, which may result from variations in quorum-controlled gene expression and protein degradation. Heterogeneity correlates with cell lineage history, too. We used single-cell data to define and quantitatively characterize the population-level quorum state. We found that the population-level QS response is well-defined. The buildup of the quorum is fast upon signal molecule addition. At the same time, its decay is much slower following signal withdrawal, and the quorum may be maintained for several hours in the absence of the signal. Furthermore, the quorum sensing response of the population was largely repeatable in subsequent pulses of signal molecules.",

We performed 7 color multispectral imaging using the Akoya Biosciences Vectra Polaris instrument under 20X magnification and a pixel size of 0.5 \u03bcm/px. We also provide clinical data including the age of surgery, highest blood glucose recording, number of intact islets in the cross section, and the range of insulitis degrees (T-/\u03b2-cell count ratios - calculated for each islet).

Each sample was dissected into small pieces and mounted on glass slides then placed under the lens whilst a attachment that held the phone over the eyepice of the microscope was fixed in place. As the phone would automatically focus the image, it was difficult to gauge how much more focus the sample required because the auto-focus would change everytime the microscope stage was moved to focus. As a result, the auto-focus was switched off before the images were taken. The phone magnification was kept at 1x so not to affect the images and each change in magnification of the microscope was recorded. ",

        "release_date": "2024-07-02",
        "description": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homologue, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), are the main transcriptional downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Decreased Hippo pathway activity leads to nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ where they interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce target gene expression. Unrestrained YAP/TAZ activity can lead to excessive growth and tumor formation in a short time, underscoring the evolutionary need for tight control of these two transcriptional coactivators. \nHere, we report that the AP-1 component JUN acts as specific repressor of YAP/TAZ at joint target sites to decrease YAP/TAZ activity. This function of JUN is independent of its heterodimeric AP-1 partner FOS and the canonical AP-1 function. Since JUN is itself induced by YAP/TAZ, our work identifies a JUN-dependent negative feedback loop that buffers YAP/TAZ activity at joint sites. This negative feedback loop gets disrupted in liver cancer to unlock the full oncogenic potential of YAP/TAZ.\nOur results thus demonstrate an additional layer of control for the important interplay of YAP/TAZ and AP-1. \n",

The \u2018PreciScan\u2019 feature of the Opera Phenix High Content Screening System was used to pre-scan each well with a low magnification objective for objects of interest (spheroids) and then a selected number of these objects were reimaged with a high magnification objective. In general, 49 fields of view (a tile of 7x7 images) were imaged for the pre-scan, which is equivalent to ca. 68 % of the entire well using the 20x objective lens. Typically, 65 planes, each 1 \u00b5m apart, were acquired. This step size was selected as it facilitated a reasonable total imaging time across the plate (see below) and manageable data size for analysis and storage, both of which are considerations for screening approaches. 100 % laser power and exposure times between 120 ms and 500 ms were used.",

        "description": "Transcriptional factors (TFs) act as key determinants of the coordination of cell death and survival by differentially modulating gene expression. Here, we systematically identified many TFs including condensate-forming TEAD4 in stressed cells. In sharp contrast to YAP-induced transcription-activating condensation of TEAD4, we found that co-factors such as VGLL4 and RFXANK could alternatively induce repressive condensation of TEAD4 to trigger cell death. Illustrated using VGLL4 as the cofactor, we mechanistically revealed that the heterotypic interactions between TEAD4 and VGLL4 favor the oligomerization and assembly of large condensates of TEAD4 to manifest a nonclassical inhibitory function of this transcription factor, i.e., causing DNA/chromatin to be aggregated and entangled, which eventually impede gene expression. Based on these findings, we engineered a linker peptide to selectively \u201cglue\u201d TEAD4 molecules together, thereby forcefully driving its condensation-induced repression of YAP-induced activation. This glue peptide displayed a strong antitumor effect via inhibition of TEAD4-related gene transcription. Collectively, this work revealed a new type of phase separation, i.e., repressive condensation of TFs, revealed how cofactor-induced differential condensation can orchestrate opposite functions of a given TF, and further developed a new class of antitumor strategies involving artificially inducing repressive condensation.

Patient-derived cells (PDCs) were established as described previously. All cells were maintained in culture supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For immunofluorescence assays, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min. Images of cells incubated with primary and secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were captured using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope with a 63 \u00d7 oil immersion lens. Twenty-five cells were scanned and analyzed using Fiji ImageJ software. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed by adding to them a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 400 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The fixative was replaced by washing the cells with 0.15 M glycine in PBS 3 times for 5 min each to quench free aldehyde. Cells were then scraped and subjected to centrifugation in order to collect them in 1% gelatin. Pellets were embedded in 12% gelatin, solidified in ice and cut into 1 mm3 blocks on a cold plate. The small blocks were immersed in 2.3 M sucrose and the immersion was rotated at 4\u00b0C overnight and transferred to an aluminium specimen holder and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections (70 nm) of the transferred material were cut at \u2212115 \u00b0C using an ultramicrotome and mounted on 100-mesh formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids. These cryosections were immune-labelled with the primary antibody and secondary antibody. After being labeled, the sections were counterstained with methylcellulose/uranyl acetate for 7 min, and imaged using an electron microscope at 120 kV.\n",

Hyaline membranes of varying thickness line the contours of most respiratory bronchioles and alveoli; at some sites, they are desquamated into their lumen. In the lumen of the bronchioles and alveoli among the fibrin filaments, the desquamated cells, macrophages and erythrocytes are seen. The branches of the pulmonary vessels are dilated and hyperemic, the capillaries of the interalveolar septa are damaged and contain desquamated endothelial cells and erythrocyte sludges in combination with focal perivascular hemorrhages. The infiltration of the interalveolar septa and the outer layers of the vessel walls is uneven, predominantly lymphoid, with an admixture of macrophages. The interalveolar septa are edematous, with uneven thickness. The bronchus wall is characterized by moderate sclerosis, hyperplasia of the mucous glands and hyperemia of the microcirculatory vascular bed. The lymphoid infiltration of the basal membrane is weak and diffuse. The bronchial epithelium is preferentially desquamated. The desquamated cells of ciliary epithelium.",

        "description": "In this study, we found that mice lacking gut microbiota displayed increased blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier permeability associated with disorganized tight junctions (TJs), which can be rescued by recolonization with gut microbiota or supplementation with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We further confirmed that the vagus nerve plays an important role in this process but SCFAs can also bypass the vagus nerve and affect blood-CSF barrier functionality. Strikingly, the administration of SCFAs in AppNL-G-F AD mice also improved the localization of TJs in the blood-CSF barrier. This was accompanied by a pronounced reduction in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden, which could be achieved by regulating microglial phenotype. Altogether, our results suggest that modulating the microbiota or administering SCFAs might have therapeutic potential in AD via tightening blood-CSF barrier and maintaining microglial activity.",

        "description": "Mitophagy is a form of selective autophagy that disposes of superfluous and potentially damage-inducing organelles in a tightly controlled manner. While the machinery involved in mitophagy induction is well known, the regulation of the components is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that TNIP1 knock out accelerates mitophagy rates, and that ectopic TNIP1 negatively regulates the rate of mitophagy. These functions of TNIP1 depend on an evolutionarily conserved LIR motif as well as an AHD3 domain, which are required for binding to the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins and the autophagy receptor TAX1BP1, respectively. We further show that phosphorylation appears to regulate its association with the ULK1 complex member FIP200, allowing TNIP1 to compete with autophagy receptors, providing a molecular rationale for its inhibitory function during mitophagy. Taken together, our findings identify a novel negative regulator of mitophagy that acts at the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis. ",

Here, we find that, compared to standard 2D suspension cultures, 3D collagen as tissue-like environment alters iDC properties and their response to HIV-1 infection. iDCs adopt an elongated morphology with increased deformability in 3D collagen at unaltered activation, differentiation, cytokine secretion or responsiveness to LPS. While 3D collagen reduces HIV-1 particle uptake by iDCs, fusion efficiency is increased to elevate productive infection rates due to elevated cell surface exposure of the HIV-1 binding receptor DC-SIGN. In contrast, 3D collagen reduces HIV transfer to CD4 T-cells from iDCs. iDC adaptation to 3D collagen include increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and reduced antiviral gene expression in response to HIV-1 infection. Adhesion to a 2D collagen matrix is sufficient to increase iDC deformability, DC-SIGN exposure and permissivity to HIV-1 infection. Thus, mechano-physical cues of 2D and 3D tissue-like collagen environments regulate iDC function and shape divergent roles during HIV-1 infection.",

As germline condensates are highly sensitive to imaging-induced stress (Elaswad et al., 2022), care was taken to avoid compression of germlines, and all animals were imaged only once and maintained on the slide for <5 min. To image entire worms, an 80 \u03bcm Z stack (1 \u03bcm step size) was captured using a 10x objective (Zeiss) with the 1x relay lens.\nEmbryos were imaged as 15 \u03bcm Z stacks (1 \u03bcm step size), captured using the 63x objective with the 2.8x relay lens. For imaging fixed germlines and embryos, prepared slides were imaged as 15 \u03bcm Z stacks (0.5 \u03bcm step size), captured using the 63x objective with the 2.8x relay lens.",

        "release_date": "2023-03-17",
        "description": "After peripheral nerve injuries, successful axonal growth and functional recovery requires the reprogramming of Schwann cells into a reparative phenotype, a process dependent on the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun. Nevertheless, axonal regeneration is greatly impaired in aged organisms or after chronic denervation leading to important clinical problems. This regenerative failure has been associated to a diminished c-Jun expression by Schwann cells, but whether the inability of these cells to maintain a repair state is associated to the transition into a phenotype inhibitory for axonal growth, has not been evaluated so far. We find that repair Schwann cells transitions into a senescent phenotype, characterized by diminished c-Jun expression and secretion of factor inhibitory for axonal regeneration in both aging and chronic denervation. In both conditions, elimination of senescent Schwann cells by systemic senolytic drug treatment or genetic targeting improves nerve regeneration and functional recovery in aging and chronic denervation, associated with an upregulation of c-Jun expression and a decrease in nerve inflammation. This work provides the first characterization of senescent Schwann cells and their impact over axonal regeneration in aging and chronic denervation, opening new avenues for enhancing regeneration, and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries.",

Striving for accurate conclusions and meaningful impact demands high reproducibility standards, with particular relevance for high-quality open-access data sharing and meta-analysis. However, the sources and degree of biological and technical variability, and thus the reproducibility and usefulness of meta-analysis of results from live-cell microscopy have not been systematically investigated. Here, using high-content data describing features of cell migration and morphology, we determine the sources of variability across different scales, including between laboratories, persons, experiments, technical repeats, cells and time points. Significant technical variability occurred between laboratories and, to lesser extent, between persons, providing low value to direct meta-analysis on the data from different laboratories. However, batch effect removal markedly improved the possibility to combine image-based datasets of perturbation experiments. Thus, reproducible quantitative high-content cell image analysis of perturbation effects and meta-analysis depend on standardized procedures combined with batch correction.",

Because images from different laboratories were acquired with different types of microscopes, Gaussian noise with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.00001 was added to the wide field images from Laboratory 2 before the cytoplasm segmentation to equalize the segmentation across laboratories as much as possible. All the other CellProfiler pipelines and parameters were the same across all the three laboratories. The nuclei were identified as primary objects using a global background thresholding method, while the corresponding cytoplasm was identified as the secondary object with an adaptive robust background thresholding strategy and a watershed method to separate touching cells. The identified cells were tracked based on the distances of nuclei between time points. All the parameter details could be found in the shared CellProfiler pipelines in the SciLifeLab Data Repository.\n2.\tIn order to identify protrusions, retractions, and short-lived cell regions, we compared consecutive, segmented cell images from the CellProfiler analysis results using tailored Matlab scripts. Protrusions were identified as regions present in a cell at a certain time point but absent in the previous. Retractions were defined as regions present at one time point but absent in the next time point. Short-lived regions are those regions that are present at only one time point but not in the ones directly before or after, corresponding to a lifetime of <10 min (Kowalewski et al., 2015).\n3D:\n1.\tFirst, the outline of the spheroid core was defined by manually setting four points far away from each other, in the 3D image stack to be analyzed, at the spheroid border. \n2.\tBased on the four points, the annotation program defined a sphere in the dataset, which was used as a reference for migration distance from the spheroid core. \n3.\tThen, the DAPI channel of the 3D image datasets was used for nuclear segmentation, segments at the border were removed and the distance of the center of each nucleus to the defined spheroid core was quantified and recorded for subsequent analysis.To optimize and validate the plugin, segmentation outputs were compared to manually annotated \u2018gold standard\u2019 images. \n4.\tAfter segmentation, the nuclei occurring in both annotation and segmentation output, the true positives, were automatically calculated. \n5.\tNext, the performance of the segmentation was quantified by calculating the precision (# true positives / # nuclei in segmentation) and recall (# true positives / # nuclei in the annotation). \n"

        "release_date": "2023-03-21",
        "description": "Significance: CSF rhinorrhea (leakage of brain fluid from the nose) can be difficult to identify and currently requires invasive procedures such as intrathecal fluorescein which requires a lumbar drain placement. Fluorescein is also known to have rare but significant side effects including seizures and death. As the number of endonasal skull base cases increase, the number of CSF leaks have also increased for which an alternative diagnostic method would be highly advantageous to patients.\nAim:  To develop an instrument to identify CSF leaks based on water absorption in the SWIR without the need of intrathecal contrast agents. This device needed to be adapted to the anatomy of the human nasal cavity while maintaining low weight and ergonomic characteristics of current surgical instruments.\nApproach: Absorption spectra of CSF and artificial CSF were obtained to characterize the absorption peaks that could be targeted with SWIR light. Different illumination systems were tested and refined prior to adapting them into a portable endoscope for testing in 3D printed models and cadavers for feasibility. \nResults: We identified CSF to have an identical absorption profile as water. In our testing, a narrow band laser source at 1480nm proved superior to using a broad 1450 nm LED. Using a SWIR enabling endoscope set up, we tested the ability to detect artificial CSF in a cadaver model.\nConclusions: An endoscopic system based on SWIR narrow band imaging can provide an alternative in the future to invasive methods of CSF leak detection.",

        "description": "The conversion of STAT proteins from latent to active transcription factors is central to cytokine signalling. Triggered by their signal-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, it is the assembly of a range of cytokine-specific STAT homo- and heterodimers that marks a key step in the transition of hitherto latent proteins to transcription activators. In contrast, the constitutive self-assembly of latent STATs and how it relates to the functioning of activated STATs, is understood less well. To provide a more complete picture, we developed a co-localisation-based assay and tested all 28 possible combinations of the seven unphosphorylated STAT proteins in living cells. It led to the identification of five U-STAT homodimers \u2015STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A and STAT5B\u2015 and two heterodimers \u2015STAT1:STAT2 and STAT5A:STAT5B\u2015 as well as semi-quantitative assessments of the forces and characterisations of binding interfaces that support them. One STAT protein \u2015STAT6\u2015 was found to be monomeric. This comprehensive analysis of latent STAT self-assembly lays bare considerable structural and functional diversity in the ways that link STAT dimerization before and after activation.",

                "description": "The STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of seven transcription factors in mammals, namely STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. These proteins are the substrate of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Janus kinases (JAK), which catalyse their phosphorylation of a single C-terminal tyrosine residue after ligand binding to cell surface receptors. About 50 different growth factors and cytokines including interferons, interleukins and growth hormones are known to signal via STAT proteins. The activated STATs accumulate in the nucleus and participate in the transcription of hundreds of genes. This sequence of events, usually referred to as canonical JAK-STAT signalling, entails the dimerization of STAT proteins through mutual phosphotyrosine:SH2 domain interactions. Such dimers can bind short palindromic stretches of DNA called GAS elements in the promoter region of target genes. In addition to homodimers, activated STATs can assemble heterodimers with the other family members. While the phosphotyrosine-mediated functions of STATs were linked to their dimerization early on, much less is known to date regarding the constitutive self-assembly of latent, that is unphosphorylated STATs (U-STATs). Initially, U-STATs were believed to be monomeric, but further studies showed that STATs can assemble high molecular weight complexes already before tyrosine phosphorylation. A well-documented example is STAT1, which forms equally strong dimers before and after activation as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, crystallographic evidence demonstrates that unphosphorylated dimers of STAT1; STAT3 and STAT5 are stabilized not by interactions of the carboxy-terminal SH2 domains, but by interactions between amino terminal regions, resulting in antiparallel orientation of monomers as opposed to their parallel orientation in the phosphodimers. It has been recognized that unphosphorylated STATs are involved in many biological events in both normal and pathological situations. In some instances, the self-assembly of U-STAT has been linked to tyrosine phosphorylation and cytokine signalling. For example, the homodimerization of U-STAT4 is a prerequisite for cytokine-induced STAT4 activation, and heterodimerization of U-STAT1 with U-STAT2 has been shown to have positive or negative consequences for type 1 and type 2 interferon signalling, respectively. These and other findings indicate that U-STAT dimers fulfil roles critical for cytokine functioning, but the knowledge of dimerization before cytokine-induced phosphorylation remains incomplete. This is particularly true for heterotypic interactions across the STAT family and the in-vivo situation generally. To fill in knowledge gaps, we devised an assay to explore systematically the repertoires of homo- and heterotypic interactions among U-STATs in living cells. The assay is based on U-STATs being nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that can freely cross the soft diffusion barrier posed by the nuclear pore, presumably via direct contacts with nuclear pore proteins. It results in generally pancellular distributions of U-STATs, which for STAT1 and STAT2 can be shifted to nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation by tagging them with transferable carrier-dependent nuclear localisation (NLS) or nuclear export (NES) signals. We reasoned that tagged variants thus could function as baits that attract co-expressed test proteins if binding interactions occurred. This would be evident by their co-localization in the bait protein\u2019s compartment. After rigorous testing and verification, this approach was used to probe homo-and heterotypic binding interactions within cells across the entire STAT family for the first time. ",

All pixel values were measured below saturation limits.\n\nThe assay scores the extent of co-localisation of a cytoplasmic or nuclear accumulated STAT protein (STAT-NES or STAT-NLS), which functions as the bait, with another STAT, the test protein, whereby the two proteins are fused to different fluorophores. We used mCherry and mEGFP, as they are monomeric, and their emission spectra display minimal overlap. Co-localisation is taken as a proxy for the degree of dimerization via homo- or heterotypic interactions. In the basic assay configuration, wild-type STAT proteins were tested. To assess dimer conformation, we tested single point mutants homologous to key interacting residues of STAT1 (F77 or L78), which are critical for the assembly of antiparallel dimers of the unphosphorylated protein. To assess dimer stability, bait and test proteins were furnished with opposed translocation signals (STAT-NES co-expressed with STAT-NLS) to provide forces that counteract the association of the two protomers in STAT dimers. For all assay configurations, knowledge of the relative cellular expression levels of the two co-expressed STAT proteins is necessary to ensure bait proteins are present in excess. As the STATs were expressed as fusions with mEGFP or mCherry, information about their relative expression levels could be obtained by comparison with a mEGFP-mCherry fusion protein, which expressed mEGFP and mCherry fluorophores in a known and fixed ratio of one-to-one. To facilitate quantification of the co-localisation assay, all images were acquired using exposure times calibrated such that the mEGFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities were approximately equal. We found that this acquisition setting reproducibly gave equivalent readings even when used on different days. Using these setting, cells were imaged, and single cells were manually segmented in ImageJ. Cells were eligible for quantitative co-localization analyses if the bait STAT protein was present from equimolar amounts to up to 4-fold molar excess compared to the co-expressed test variant. To obtain quantitative estimates of the degree of co-localization in the images, Pearson (rP) and Spearman (rS, given in the source data files) correlation coefficients were calculated for individual cells with the PSC co-localization ImageJ plug-in as described. Both tests produce values in the range [\u22121, 1], 0 indicating that there is no discernible correlation and \u22121 and +1 meaning strong negative and positive correlations, respectively. Cells where fewer than 1000 pixels had intensity values above that which might be considered image noise for at least one of the channels at that data point were also deemed ineligible and excluded from further calculations. The PSC programme\u2019s default intensity setting of 40 was used as the image noise threshold. Values for Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for 10-30 eligible cells per experiment and are given as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). "

Cells were transfected at ~80% confluence using Lipofectamine LTX according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Invitrogen) with the following modifications. For co-localisation assays, HeLa cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 1.2 \u00b5g DNA, 2 \u00b5l lipofectamine and 2 \u00b5l PLUS reagent per well, whereby DNA encoding the bait protein was used in about 2-fold excess. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB; Cell Signaling Technology) to inactivate NES-mediated nuclear export. \n\nExpression constructs\nSTAT proteins were expressed with mCherry or mEGFP fused to the C-terminus through cloning into pmCherry-N1 (Clontech) and pmEGFP-N1 (derived from pEGFP-N1, encoding A206K mutant of EGFP, Clontech), respectively. Cytoplasmic or nuclear accumulation of fusion proteins was achieved by appending canonical nuclear export (NES) or nuclear import (NLS) signal sequences. We used the NES from protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI, 34NSNELALKLAGLDINK49) and the NLS from simian virus 40 large T-antigen (SV40, 126PKKKRKV132). Where a single signal was appended, the respective cDNA sequence was placed between STAT and fluorophore, encoding additional 3-5 heterologous residues N- and C-terminal of the NES or NLS sequence. To express STAT1 with dual NES and NLS signals, plasmid pSTAT1-NES-mEGFP was used and the SV40 NLS (plus an additional C-terminal glutamate residue) was placed downstream of the fluorophore. STAT2\u0394C is a C-terminally truncated variant expressing residues 1-703. N-domain mutations were as follows, STAT1-F77A, STAT2-L82A, STAT3-L78R, STAT4-L78S, STAT5A-L82A, STAT5B-L82A. Plasmid pmEGFP-mCherry encoded mEGFP fused to the N-terminus of mCherry. The two fluorophores were linked via an extended rigid helical linker (1YSDLELAEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKAAARDPPVAT42) to minimize basal F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer. The mutations were introduced using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs). Sequences of all the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

        "release_date": "2023-04-11",
        "description": "Studies of postmortem human tissue provide insight into pathological processes, but are inherently limited by practical considerations that limit the scale at which tissue can be examined, and the obvious issue that the tissue reflects only one time point in a continuous disease process.  We approached this problem by adapting new tissue clearance techniques to an entire cortical area of human brain, which allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of neurons throughout the depth of the entire cortical thickness.  This approach allows detection of \u201crare\u201d events, that may be difficult to detect in standard 5 micron-thick paraffin sections. For example, it is well established that neurofibrillary tangles begin within a neuron, and ultimately, in at least some instances, persist in the brain even after the neuron has died. These are referred to as \u201cghost tangles\u201d, a term that appropriately implies their \u201cdifficult to see\u201d ephemeral qualities. We set out to find ghost tangles as one example of the power of the tissue clearance/image analysis techniques to detect rare events, and to learn what happens at the end point of a tangle\u2019s life history. We were able to identify 8103 AT8+ tau tangles, 132465 HuD+ neurons, and 299640 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Braak V-VI) and 4 AT8+ tau tangles, 200447 HuD+ neurons, and 462715 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with no significant tau pathology (Braak 0-I).  Among these data we located 57 ghost tangles, which makes them only 0.7% of the total tau tangles observed. We found that ghost tangles are more likely to be found in cortical layers 3 and 5 (49/57), with a select few scattered across other layers 1, 2, 4, and 6. This ability to find rare events, such as ghost tangles, in large enough quantities to statistically test their distribution exemplifies how tissue clearing can be used as a powerful tool for studying selective vulnerability or resilience to pathology across brain regions.",

The staining was then segmented using Ilastik\u2019s pixel classifier workflow. Pixel probability maps and raw data were loaded into Ilastik\u2019s object classification workflow. 1000x1000 pixel regions of each tissue z-stack were cropped and used to train object classifiers. DAPI and Hud object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, single cells, or inseparable clusters of cells. Tau object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, incomplete circle, complete circle, and solid circle shapes. Data was processed as 500x500x20 blocks and applied over the entire image volumes. Data was exported as object identities and spreadsheets with information about the objects\u2019 classification and characteristics, which were then loaded into matlab code to match objects from each channel with colocalized objects."

Here, we develop and apply FateMap, a framework that combines DNA barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the fates of hundreds of thousands of clones exposed to anti-cancer therapies. We show that resistant clones emerging from single-cell-derived cancer cells adopt molecularly, morphologically, and functionally distinct fate types. These different resistant types are largely predetermined by molecular differences between cells before addition of drug and not by extrinsic cell-specific microenvironmental factors. Changes in dose and kind of drug can, however, switch the resistant fate type of an initial cell, even resulting in the generation and elimination of certain fate types. Diversity in resistant fates was observed across several single-cell-derived cancer cell lines and types treated with a variety of drugs. Cell fate diversity as a result of variability in intrinsic cell states may be a generic feature of response to external cues.",

The wells (within the 6-well plates) were pseudo-named in a format independent from drug or dose. Nikon-generated nd2 files were first parsed using custom MATLAB scripts (rajlabformattools) to convert them from nd2 format to tiff format. The code can be found here: https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabformattools. Images for each well were then stitched using custom MATLAB code and the number of cells in each well was counted using custom MATLAB code with a Gaussian filter consistent across samples being compared (colonycounting_v2). Colonies within each well were manually segmented and MATLAB was used to calculate the total number of colonies, cells per colony, and cells outside of colonies. The code can be found here: https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/colonycounting_v2. The gene counts for individual cells within each colony is provided at the dropbox link, and summary average counts for each colony is provided in Supplementary Table 10.\n\nFor immunofluorescence, all image processing was done blind to drug conditions; the wells were pseudo-named in a format independent from drug or dose. Nikon images were first stitched using Nikon Elements software. The channels were split in Fiji and scaled to a smaller size compared to their original pixel size prior to placing them in illustrator. For the conditions being compared (e.g. each well with a different drug dose/type), the individual channels were equally adjusted for brightness and contrast across each pair of wells for the signal of interest. Raw nd2 files are provided for each imaging experiment which contains additional metadata for image settings. For the images taken on the brightfield microscope Nikon TS2FL, the scale bar lengths were calculated by using the pixel size given by the manufacturer of the camera. For well images taken on the Nikon TI-E inverted fluorescence microscope, the scale bar lengths were calculated using Nikon Elements software to add a line of a specific length to the images."

We tuned the exposure times depending on the dyes used (Cy3, Atto 647N, Alexa 594, and DAPI). For large tiled scans, we used a Nikon Perfect Focus system to maintain focus across the imaging area. For imaging RNA FISH signals in tissue sections, we acquired z-stacks (three positions) at 60X magnification, and used maximum intensity projection to visualize the signal. For brightfield imaging of resistant colonies, we used a Nikon Eclipse Ts2-FL with an Imagingsource DFK 33UX252 camera and 4X Plan-Fluor 4X/0.13 (Nikon MRH20041) objective. For time-lapse imaging of the emergence of drug-resistant colonies, we used an IncuCyte S3 Live Cell Imaging Analysis System (Sartorius) with a 4X objective on WM989 A6-G3 tagged with an mCherry nuclear reporter (H2B-mCherry).

The identities of WM989 A6-G3 and WM983B E9-C6 were verified 1 by DNA STR microsatellite fingerprinting at the Wistar Institute. WM989 A6-G3 5a3, first described in 2, was derived by single-cell bottlenecking of WM989 A6-G3. MDA-MB-231-D4, first described in 3 was derived by single-cell bottlenecking of MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26). The identity of MDA-MB-231-D4 was verified 3 by ATCC human STR profiling cell line authentication services. WM3451 P2G7 and WM3623 P4E7 were derived by single-cell bottlenecking WM3451 and WM3623 respectively, both of which were kindly provided by the lab of Dr. Meenhard Herlyn and verified by ATCC human STR profiling cell line authentication services.\n\nFOM230-1 primary melanocytes were also kindly provided by the lab of Dr. Meenhard Herlyn. Briefly, they obtained foreskin tissue from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. The foreskin was cut into pieces (approximately 5mm x 5mm), transferred into a tube containing dispase II, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 15-18 hours. The next day the epidermis was separated from the dermis and the epidermal sheets were minced as small as possible. 0.05% trypsin was added, and the minced sheets were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3-5 minutes depending on cell disaggregation. This mixture was then pipetted up and down vigorously to release single cells from the epidermal sheets. The trypsin was neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1,200 rpm at room temperature. The supernatant was aspirated to remove any remaining stratum corneum. The cell pellet was then resuspended with melanocyte growth medium. \n\nWM989 A6-G3, WM989 A6-G3 5a3, WM983b E9-C6, WM3451 P2G7, and WM3623 P4E7 melanoma cell lines were cultured in TU2% media (80% MCDB 153, 10% Leibovitz\u2019s L-15, 2% FBS, 2.4mM CaCl2, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin). MDA-MB-231 cell lines were cultured in DMEM10% (DMEM with glutamax, 10% FBS and 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin). All six cell lines were passaged using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. FOM 230-1 melanocyte cells were cultured in Melanocyte Growth Medium (PromoCell, C-24010). Melanocytes were passaged using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and neutralized using soybean trypsin inhibitor (Gibco, 17075-029).\n\nExperiments in mice\nFor each experiment, WM989 cells were uniquely barcoded with protocols as described above and allowed to divide 4-5 times before splitting the barcoded pool into five groups, each containing an equal number of cells. We aimed for ~1-1.5 million WM989 cells to be injected per mice. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines and regulations. The protocols have been approved by the Wistar IACUC. WM989 cells in serum-free RPMI 1640 media (Corning 10-40-CM) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Corning 354230), then were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of NSG mice. Once tumors reached about 100mm3 per caliper measurement, animals were randomized into treatment groups. Treatment consisted of Low Dose 41.7 mg PLX4720/kg diet (Research Diets D21051202i), or High Dose 417 mg PLX4720/kg diet (Research Diets D21051201i), to which they had constant access. PLX4720 is closely related both structurally and biologically to PLX4032, which was used for in vitro experiments, and also targets the same molecule and BRAF-V600E structural configuration. As PLX4720 continues to be the drug used in mouse xenograft models and has a similar half-life to PLX4032 (Kaur et al., Nature, 2016; and Torre et al., Nature Genetics 2021), we used PLX4730 instead of PLX4032 for in vivo experiments. Tumor size was measured by calipers every 2-4 days, and tumor volumes were calculated according to the equation 0.5*L*W*W, where L is the longest side and W is a line perpendicular to L. Mice were sacrificed once tumors reached 1500 mm3, and once one mouse reached the endpoint, all mice from the same barcode pool were sacrificed regardless of tumor size. The tumor tissue was snap frozen in liquid N2 for genomic DNA extraction. We had 5 biological replicate experiments. We could not extract sufficient gDNA from experiments 3 and 4, and these were excluded from barcode split population analysis. "

        "description": "Nix is a membrane-anchored outer mitochondrial protein than induces mitophagy.  While Nix has a LIR motif for binding to ATG8 proteins, it also contains a MER (minimal essential region) that induces mitophagy through an unknown mechanism.  We use chemically induced dimerization (CID) to probe the mechanism of Nix-mediated mitophagy and find that both the LIR and MER are required for robust mitophagy.  We find that the Nix MER interacts with WIPI2 and recruits WIPI2 to mitochondria.  The Nix LIR motif is also required for robust mitophagy and converting WIPI2 coating the mitochondria into puncta, independently of Atg8s. Together this work reveals unanticipated mechanisms in Nix-induced mitophagy and the elusive role of the MER, while also revealing an interesting example of autophagy induction downstream of the Ulk1 initiation and PI3K complexes.",

        "description": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is an important biomedical model organism used in many disciplines. The phenomenon of developmental delay in zebrafish embryos has been widely reported as part of a mutant or treatment-induced phenotype. However, the detection and quantification of these delays is often achieved through manual observation with reference to staging guides, which is both time-consuming and subjective. We recently reported a machine learning-based classifier, capable of quantifying the developmental delay between two populations of zebrafish embryos. Here, we build on that work by introducing a deep learning-based model that has been trained to predict the age (hours post fertilisation) of populations of zebrafish embryos. We show that when KimmelNet is tested on 2D brightfield images of zebrafish embryos, the predictions generated agree closely with those expected from established approaches to staging. Random sampling of the test data demonstrate that KimmelNet can be used to detect developmental delay between two populations with high confidence based on as few as 100 images of each population. Finally, we show that KimmelNet generalises to previously unseen data, with limited transfer learning improving this performance significantly. With the ability to analyse tens of thousands of standard brightfield microscopy images on a timescale of minutes, we envisage that KimmelNet will be a valuable resource for the developmental biology community. Furthermore, the approach we have used could easily be adapted to generate models for other organisms.",

        "description": "In vivo imaging using shortwave infrared light (SWIR, 1000-2000 nm) benefits from deeper penetration and higher resolution compared to using visible and near-infrared wavelengths. However, the development of biocompatible SWIR contrast agents remains challenging. Despite recent advancements, small molecule SWIR fluorophores are often hindered by their significant hydrophobicity. We report a platform for generating a panel of soluble and functional dyes for SWIR imaging by late-stage functionalization of a versatile fluorophore intermediate, affording water-soluble dyes with bright SWIR fluorescence in serum. Specifically, a tetra-sulfonate derivative enables clear video-rate imaging of vasculature with only 0.05 nmol dye, and a tetra-ammonium dye shows strong cellular retention for tracking of tumor growth. Additionally, incorporation of phosphonate functionality enables imaging of bone in awake mice. This modular design provides insights for facile derivatization of existing SWIR fluorophores to introduce both solubility and bioactivity towards in vivo bioimaging.",

        "description": "During embryonic development, oriented cell divisions are important for patterned tissue growth and cell fate specification. Cell division orientation is controlled in part by asymmetrically localized polarity proteins, which establish functional domains of the cell membrane and interact with microtubule regulators to position the mitotic spindle. For example, in the 8-cell mouse embryo, apical polarity proteins form caps on the outside, contact-free surface of the embryo that position the mitotic spindle to execute asymmetric cell division. A similar radial or \u201cinside-outside\u201d polarity is established at an early stage in many other animal embryos, but in most cases it remains unclear how inside-outside polarity is established and how it influences downstream cell behaviors. Here, we explore inside-outside polarity in C. elegans somatic blastomeres using spatiotemporally controlled protein degradation and live embryo imaging. We show that PAR polarity proteins, which form apical caps at the center of the contact free membrane, localize dynamically during the cell cycle and contribute to spindle orientation and proper cell positioning. Surprisingly, isolated single blastomeres lacking cell contacts are able to break symmetry and form PAR-3/aPKC caps. Polarity caps form independently of actomyosin flows and microtubules, and can regulate spindle orientation in cooperation with the key polarity kinase aPKC. Together, our results reveal a role for apical polarity caps in regulating spindle orientation in symmetrically dividing cells and provide novel insights into how these structures are formed.",

        "description": "Motile cells encounter microenvironments of locally heterogeneous mechanochemical composition. Individual compositional parameters like chemokines and pore sizes are well known to provide guidance cues for pathfinding. However, motile cells face diverse cues at the same time, raising the question of how they respond to diverse and potentially competing signals on their paths. Here, we reveal that amoeboid cells require nuclear repositioning, termed nucleokinesis, for adaptive pathfinding in heterogeneous mechanochemical micro-environments. Using mammalian immune cells and the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we discover that frequent, rapid and long-distance nucleokinesis is a basic component of amoeboid pathfinding, enabling cells to reorientate quickly between locally competing cues. Amoeboid nucleokinesis comprises a two-step polarity switch and is driven by myosin-II forces, readjusting the nuclear to the cellular path. Impaired nucleokinesis distorts path adaptions and causes cellular arrest in the microenvironment. Our findings establish that nucleokinesis is required for amoeboid cell navigation. Given that many immune cells, amoebae, and some cancer cells utilize an amoeboid migration strategy, these results suggest that nucleokinesis underlies cellular navigation during unicellular biology, immunity, and disease.\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.19.540965.

        "release_date": "2023-11-04",
        "description": "Data for Immunofluorescence experiments - \nThe phospholipid and free fatty acid (FFA) composition of neuronal membranes plays a crucial role in learning and memory, but the mechanisms through which neuronal activity affects the brain's lipid landscape remain largely unexplored. Saturated FFAs, particularly myristic acid (C14:0), strongly increase during neuronal stimulation and memory acquisition, suggesting the involvement of phospholipase A1 (PLA1) activity in synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that genetic ablation of the DDHD2 isoform of PLA1 in mice markedly reduced saturated FFAs across the brain and memory performance in reward-based learning and spatial memory models prior to the development of neuromuscular deficits. DDHD2 was shown to bind to the key synaptic protein STXBP1. Using STXBP1/2 knockout neurosecretory cells and a haploinsufficient STXBP1+/- mouse model of STXBP1 encephalopathy that is also associated with intellectual disability and motor dysfunction, we show that STXBP1 controls the targeting of DDHD2 to the plasma membrane and the generation of saturated FFAs in the brain. Our findings suggest key roles for DDHD2 and STXBP1 in the lipid metabolism underlying synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.",

        "description": "This study aimed to expand our understanding of myelin basic protein (MBP), a key component of central nervous system myelin, by tracking and quantifying individual MBP particles during oligodendrocyte differentiation. MBP particle directionality, confinement and diffusion were tracked by rapid TIRF and HILO imaging of dendra2 tagged MBP in three stages of mouse oligodendroglia: oligodendrocyte precursors, early myelinating oligodendrocytes, and mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The directionality and confinement of MBP particles increased at each stage consistent with the progressive transport towards, and recruitment into, emerging myelin structures. Unexpectedly, diffusion data presented a more complex pattern with sub-populations of the most diffusive particles disappearing at the transition between the precursor and early myelinating stage, before re-emerging in the membrane sheets of mature oligodendrocytes. This diversity of particle behaviours, which would be undetectable by conventional ensemble averaged methods, are consistent with a multifunctional view of MBP involving roles in myelin expansion and compaction.\n",

        "description": "TP53-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are characterized by chemotherapy resistance and represent an unmet clinical need. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells might be a promising therapeutic option for TP53-mutant AML/MDS. However, the impact of TP53 deficiency in AML cells on the efficacy of CAR T-cells is unknown.\nWe here show that CAR T-cells engaging TP53-deficient leukemia cells exhibit a prolonged interaction time, upregulate exhaustion markers, and are inefficient to control AML cell outgrowth in vitro and in vivo compared to TP53 wildtype cells. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the mevalonate pathway is upregulated in TP53-deficient AML cells under CAR T-cell attack, while CAR T-cells engaging TP53-deficient AML cells downregulate the Wnt pathway. In vitro rational targeting of either of these pathways rescues AML cell sensitivity to CAR T-cell-mediated killing. \nWe thus demonstrate that TP53 deficiency confers resistance to CAR T-cell therapy and identify the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic vulnerability of TP53-deficient AML cells engaged by CAR T-cells, and the Wnt pathway as a promising CAR T-cell therapy-enhancing approach for TP53-deficient AML/MDS.",

        "description": "Molecular interactions are key to all cellular processes, and particularly interesting to investigate in the context of gene regulation. Protein\u2013protein interactions are challenging to examine in vivo as they are dynamic, and require spatially and temporally resolved studies to interrogate them. Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a highly sensitive imaging method, which can interrogate molecular interactions. FRET can be detected by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM-FRET), which is more robust to concentration variations and photobleaching than intensity-based FRET but typically needs long acquisition times to achieve high photon counts. New variants of non-fitting lifetime-based FRET perform well in samples with lower signal and require less intensive instrument calibration and analysis, making these methods ideal for probing protein\u2013protein interactions in more complex live 3D samples. Here we show that a non-fitting FLIM-FRET variant, based on the Average Arrival Time of photons per pixel (AAT\u2212 FRET), is a sensitive and simple way to detect and measure protein\u2013protein interactions in live early stage zebrafish embryos.",

For some images, mCitrine/mCherry intensity channels were used to verify/carry out segmentation. Background subtraction using a rolling ball radius of \u223c10 pixels and Gaussian blur of \u223c0.9 \u03bcm were performed on the SiR-DNA channel (settings varied for embryos with different SiR-DNA signal patterns). The resultant stack was used to perform 3D nuclear segmentation was carried out using Trackmate with the built-in StarDist detector (Ershov et al. 2022). 2D ROIs representing segmented nuclei detected on each z-planes were filtered by manual thresholding of radius, signal-to-noise, and quality features, as well as manual inspection to remove false detections. The remaining detections were linked together using the Trackmate overlap tracker to create a 3D label stack, which was used to extract the pixel intensity and AAT values for each nucleus from original image stack using the 3D ImageJ Suite.36, 37 For single z-planes pre-/post-bleach images, nuclei were segmented manually (Fiji or LAS-X), and pixel intensity and AAT values were extracted for each nucleus.\nNucleus ROI data from Fiji processing, giving an intensity and AAT value per pixel were imported into Python 338 and processed using Pandas39 and NumPy.40 Plots were made using Seaborn.41 Pixels were binned into 0.1 ns AAT bins (matching the detector resolution), and pixel intensities for each AAT bin summed, creating an AAT versus intensity plot for individual ROIs. These match the AAT plots imported from nuclei segmented in LAS-X. AAT plots were normalised to an intensity of 1, averaged across each condition and re-normalised to create line graphs for visual comparison. The mean-weighted AAT per nucleus was calculated from individual ROI AAT plots using the calculation :\nmean weighted AAT = total (AAT x (I/Imax))/total ((I/Imax)), where I is the Intensity at a given AAT (sum of photons counted in pixels with given AAT) and Imax is the maximum Intensity value for a given ROI.\nmfD was calculated per pixel from AAT values. Mean weighted mfD was calculated as for Mean Weighted AAT:\nmfD = 1-(AAT:D+A/total(mean weighted AAT:D)/((AAT:D+A/2(total(mean weighted AAT:D))-1)^2.\nmfD and mean weighted mfD values <0 were set to 0, as the minimum fraction cannot be lower than 0%.\nIntensity-based and lifetime-based FRET Efficiency were calculated: \n E = 1-I:D+A/I:D\nwhere I:D+A is the is the average nuclear intensity of the donor in presence of the acceptor from across all 3 embryos and I:D is the average nuclear intensity of the donor alone.\nE = 1- \u03c4:D+A/ \u03c4:D\nwhere \u03c4:D+A is the average AAT of the donor in presence of the acceptor from nuclei across all 3 embryos and \u03c4:D is the average AAT of the donor alone.\nIntensity-based apparent FRET efficiency was calculated for acceptor photobleaching: E = 1- I:D+A(pre-bleach)/I:D+A(post-bleach)."

        "description": "Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) towards different neuronal lineages has enabled diverse cellular models of human neurodevelopment and related disorders. However, in vitro differentiation is a variable process that frequently leads to heterogeneous cell populations that may confound disease-relevant phenotypes. To characterize the baseline and diversity of cortical neurodevelopment in vitro, we differentiated iPSC lines from multiple healthy donors to cortical neurons and profiled the transcriptomes of 60,000 single cells across three timepoints spanning 70 days. We compared the cell types observed in vitro to those seen in vivo and in organoid cultures to assess how well iPSC-derived cells recapitulate neurodevelopment in vivo. We found that over 60% of the cells resembled those seen in the fetal brain with high confidence, while 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes observed in organoids. Further, we used high-content imaging to quantify morphological phenotypes of the differentiating neurons across the same time points using Cell Painting. By modeling the relationship between image-based features and gene expression, we compared cell type- and donor-specific effects across the two modalities at single cell resolution. We found that while morphological features capture broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, they enhance our ability to quantify the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Finally, we show that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive molecular atlas of human cortical neuron development in vitro that introduces a relevant framework for disease modeling.",

For neural inductions, 2-3 80% confluent plates of iPS cells were detached using 0.5 mM EDTA and were plated on a Matrigel plate (1:100 in DMEM/F12) in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 (10 \u03bcM). Dual-SMAD inhibition was initiated the following day using Neural Maintenance Medium (NMM) supplemented with SB431542 (10 \u03bcM) and LDN-193189 (200 nM) (Table S5). On day 11 post-induction, cells were split in clumps in 1:2 ratio onto laminin-coated dishes using either mechanical dissociation by gentle scraping (modified) or using Dispase (original). The following day, the media was changed to NMM containing bFGF (0.2 \u03bcg/ml) for four days. After expansion, cells were split (1:2) with EDTA only in the modified protocol. Alternatively, a few replicates (techRep column, Table S2) for days 40 and 70 were dissociated with Dispase as per the original protocol. At day 17, the plates to be assayed at day 20 (modified protocol) were split 1:2 as small clumps (using 0.5 \u03bcM EDTA) onto laminin-coated plates for scRNA-seq analysis. Additionally, cells were plated in 1:6 ratio on 24-well plates with coverslips for immunocytochemistry and in 1:120 ratio on 384-well plates for Cell Painting. Cells assayed at days 40 and 70 were split as described in Table S2. All cells were frozen down at day 28 or 29 and thawed as per the original protocol. Cells were frozen down in 1:1 ratio and were plated onto laminin-coated plates at thawing. Final plating for days 40 and 70 was done at day 35 when cells were passaged with Accutase. Cells were plated for scRNA-seq (1.5 million cells/35mm dish), immunocytochemistry (75-300,000 cells/24-well plate) and Cell Painting (5,000 cells/384-well plate) onto poly-L-ornithine and laminin-coated plates. Poly-L-ornithine solution was diluted to 0.01% with sterile water, coated overnight at +4\u00b0C after which the wells were washed 3 times with sterile water. Laminin was diluted in DPBS-/- and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4h."

High-content microscopy is indispensable in the drug discovery process but the sensitivity relies on the accuracy of mature synapse detection. We present a workflow whereby synchronous calcium bursting is measured in GCaMP6f-transduced neurons. The same cultures are then subjected to Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) to label mature synapses, the neurite network and nuclei. The integration of functional and morphological information provides a rich fingerprint of neuronal connectivity, deployable in different experimental conditions. ",

Next, the nuclei mask is subtracted from the neurite mask after which the new mask is dilated to obtain a search region in which synaptic spots are detected. The spots are first enhanced using a gaussian, Laplacian or multi-scale Laplacian filter with a user-defined kernel size. Next, a threshold is applied to segment the synapse spots. "

        "description": "This dataset comprises the raw data associated with Wong et al., EMBO J., 2024. \"Regulation of centrosome size by the cell cycle oscillator in Drosophila embryos\". This dataset (approximately 900Gb in total) tracks the behavior of individual centrosomes (labelled with different centrosome markers) in early Drosophila embryos during nuclear cycles 11-13 under various conditions. The datasets are organised to align with each individual Figure shown in the paper. \n\nThe paper abstract is: Mitotic centrosomes assemble when centrioles recruit large amounts of pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. In early C. elegans embryos, mitotic centrosome size appears to be set by the limiting amount of a key component. In Drosophila syncytial embryos, thousands of mitotic centrosomes are assembled as the embryo proceeds through 13 rounds of rapid nuclear division, driven by a core cell-cycle oscillator. These divisions slow during nuclear cycles 11-13, and we find that centrosomes respond by reciprocally decreasing their growth rate, but increasing their growth period\u2014so that they grow to a relatively consistent size at each cycle. At the start of each cycle, moderate CCO activity initially promotes centrosome growth, in part by stimulating Polo/PLK1 recruitment to centrosomes. Later in each cycle, high CCO activity inhibits centrosome growth by suppressing the centrosomal recruitment and/or maintenance of centrosome proteins. Thus, in fly embryos, mitotic centrosome size appears to be regulated predominantly by the core cell-cycle oscillator, rather than by the depletion of a limiting component.",
