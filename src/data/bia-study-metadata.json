    "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

            "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

            "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

    "release_date": "2024-05-17",
    "description": "We present a 3D digital atlas of Cardamine hirsuta ovule development with cellular resolution. The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth (stage 1-I) to the mature pre-fertilization ovule (stage 3-VI). The atlas provides information about the number of cells, their tissue classification, and about characteristics of cellular morphology, such as cell size and shape, for nearly all cells of the ovule. The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods.

    "title": "Single-cell level LasR-mediated quorum sensing response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to pulses of signal molecules",
    "release_date": "2024-05-03",
    "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication form between bacteria via small signal molecules that enables global gene regulation as a function of cell density. We applied a microfluidic mother machine to study the kinetics of the QS response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to additions and withdrawals of signal molecules. We traced the fast buildup and the subsequent considerably slower decay of a population-level and single-cell-level QS response. We applied a mathematical model to explain the results quantitatively. We found significant heterogeneity in QS on the single-cell level, which may result from variations in quorum-controlled gene expression and protein degradation. Heterogeneity correlates with cell lineage history, too. We used single-cell data to define and quantitatively characterize the population-level quorum state. We found that the population-level QS response is well-defined. The buildup of the quorum is fast upon signal molecule addition. At the same time, its decay is much slower following signal withdrawal, and the quorum may be maintained for several hours in the absence of the signal. Furthermore, the quorum sensing response of the population was largely repeatable in subsequent pulses of signal molecules.",

    "title": "Spatial characterization of tangle-bearing neurons and ghost tangles in the human inferior temporal gyrus with three-dimensional imaging",
    "release_date": "2023-04-11",
    "description": "Studies of postmortem human tissue provide insight into pathological processes, but are inherently limited by practical considerations that limit the scale at which tissue can be examined, and the obvious issue that the tissue reflects only one time point in a continuous disease process.  We approached this problem by adapting new tissue clearance techniques to an entire cortical area of human brain, which allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of neurons throughout the depth of the entire cortical thickness.  This approach allows detection of \u201crare\u201d events, that may be difficult to detect in standard 5 micron-thick paraffin sections. For example, it is well established that neurofibrillary tangles begin within a neuron, and ultimately, in at least some instances, persist in the brain even after the neuron has died. These are referred to as \u201cghost tangles\u201d, a term that appropriately implies their \u201cdifficult to see\u201d ephemeral qualities. We set out to find ghost tangles as one example of the power of the tissue clearance/image analysis techniques to detect rare events, and to learn what happens at the end point of a tangle\u2019s life history. We were able to identify 8103 AT8+ tau tangles, 132465 HuD+ neurons, and 299640 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Braak V-VI) and 4 AT8+ tau tangles, 200447 HuD+ neurons, and 462715 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with no significant tau pathology (Braak 0-I).  Among these data we located 57 ghost tangles, which makes them only 0.7% of the total tau tangles observed. We found that ghost tangles are more likely to be found in cortical layers 3 and 5 (49/57), with a select few scattered across other layers 1, 2, 4, and 6. This ability to find rare events, such as ghost tangles, in large enough quantities to statistically test their distribution exemplifies how tissue clearing can be used as a powerful tool for studying selective vulnerability or resilience to pathology across brain regions.",

The staining was then segmented using Ilastik\u2019s pixel classifier workflow. Pixel probability maps and raw data were loaded into Ilastik\u2019s object classification workflow. 1000x1000 pixel regions of each tissue z-stack were cropped and used to train object classifiers. DAPI and Hud object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, single cells, or inseparable clusters of cells. Tau object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, incomplete circle, complete circle, and solid circle shapes. Data was processed as 500x500x20 blocks and applied over the entire image volumes. Data was exported as object identities and spreadsheets with information about the objects\u2019 classification and characteristics, which were then loaded into matlab code to match objects from each channel with colocalized objects."

Tissue was then rinsed 3 times with 50ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes each, then placed in fresh PBS overnight at 4, and rinsed with fresh PBS. Fixed tissue underwent three rinsing cycles in 10-minute increments using 50ml of PBS, then were placed in fresh PBS overnight at 4oC. In preparation for tissue slicing, tissue was transferred to individual 35 mm Petri dishes and embedded in a gel block by pouring warm 4% agarose gel solution in PBS (4g/100ml) (Promega, cat No. V3121) over the tissue. The gel was then cooled to solidify, and cut into a block to provide rigidity for cutting even slices. The tissue was secured on Vibratome (Leica Biosystems, VT1000 S Vibrating Blade Microtome) slide via super gluing the bottom of the agarose block. The vibratome was then used to slice 0.5-1mm thick sections of tissue. Each slice was then removed from the agarose through gentle manipulation with blunt forceps or paintbrushes and were then placed in crosslinking solution, described below.\n\nEach slice was incubated with a hydrogel crosslinking solution containing PBS with 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, ca No. A3553) and 0.25% (wt/vol) VA-044 thermal polymerization initiator (Fisher Scientific, ca No. NC0632395) for 1 day at 4oC to let the molecules diffuse through the tissue. Solutions must be kept cold before and after the addition of VA-044 to prevent premature initiation of polymerization. After incubation with the crosslinking solution for 1 day, the tissue was left in solution and placed in vacuum at 37oC for 3 hours. After polymerization with X-CLARITY polymerization system (Logos Biosystems, South Korea), the slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS three times over 3 hours. \n\nTissue was then placed into Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. L3771) 28.83g/ 500ml PBS clearing solution supplemented with Sodium Borate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. S9640) on shaker at 100 rpm and 37C for approximately 3 days. After delipidation, the brain slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS five times over 24 hours.\n\nEach brain slice was placed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube that could hold the slice so its large, flat sides could be exposed to solution. PBST (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to just cover the top of the samples (~500 \u00b5l). Tissue was heated to 50oC for 1 hour in PBST and then cooled to room temperature prior to incubation with antibodies. The following conjugated antibodies were then added to the solution containing each tissue slice: phospho-tau Ser202, Thr 205 (AT8, 1.6:500, ThermoFisher, cat No. MN1020) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher, cat No. A37573), HuD Antibody E-1 (1.6:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat No. sc-28299) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (ThermoFisher, cat No. A37571), and 4\u2019,6-Diamidine-2\u2019-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1.6:500, Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. 10236276001).

            "protocol_description": "- Live cell imaging and high speed imaging\nThe live imaging was performed as previously described method. In brief, the organisms were introduced in a rectangular microfluidic chip (length 2.2cm, width 1cm, height 150\u03bcm) of glass slides with copper side walls which act as electrodes. A high speed camera (Phantom V1210 camera, 10000fps) mounted to the microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2, 40X DIC objective) and an electrophysiological DC pulse generator (Grass instruments, S88) were synchronized with a micro-controller (Arduino Uno). Pulse voltage and duration were chosen according to previously reported results.\n\n- Transmission Electron Microscopy\nSpirostomum ambiguum were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PHEM buffer for at least one hour at room temperature. The samples were stained with Safranin-O and stabilized in 1% low melting point agarose, then cut into 1mm cubes. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, room temperature (RT)) in 1X PBS, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 1xPBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, RT) in buffer and then briefly in distilled water. Samples were then subjected to an ascending acetone gradient (10min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%) followed by pure acetone (2\u00d7; 10 min, RT). Samples were progressively infiltrated with Epon resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), while rocking, and then polymerized at 60\u2103 for 24-48 hours in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), collected on glass slides and used for general orientation. Thin sections (70-80 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. Thin sections were\npost-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate, 5 mins each. Then sections were either imaged using a Tecnai 12 120kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) at UC Berkeley, or imaged in the JEOL JEM-1400 120kV with photo taken using a Gatan Orius 2k X 2k digital camera at Stanford University. The montage image was created by SerialEM. All segmentation of organelles was done manually on Fiji.\n\n- Confocal Imaging\nSpirostomum ambiguum were stained alive in 625ng/mL DiOC6(3) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #318426-250MG) and 500nM MitoTracker\u2122 Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #M7510) for 30 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

    "description": "Molecular subtyping of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) has been performed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level. However, LUSC stratification based on tissue metabolomics is still lacking. Combining high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry with consensus clustering, four tumor- and four stroma-specific subtypes with distinct metabolite patterns were identified in 330 LUSC patients. The first tumor subtype T1 negatively correlated with DNA damage and immunological features including CD3, CD8, and PD-L1. The same features positively correlated with the tumor subtype T2. Tumor subtype T4 was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Compared with the status of subtypes T1 and T4, patients with subtype T3 had improved prognosis, and T3 was an independent prognostic factor with regard to UICC stage. Similarly, stroma subtypes were linked to distinct immunological features and metabolic pathways. Stroma subtype S4 had a better prognosis than S2. Subsequently, analyses based on an independent LUSC cohort treated by neoadjuvant therapy revealed that the S2 stroma subtype was associated with chemotherapy resistance. Clinically relevant patient subtypes as determined by tissue-based spatial metabolomics are a valuable addition to existing molecular classification systems. Metabolic differences among the subtypes and their associations with immunological features may contribute to the improvement of personalized therapy.",

    "description": "Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta's heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the \u2018Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY\u2019 (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY\u2019s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature.",

    "description": "Recently, a low-level somatic mutation in the NRAS gene (c.182 A > G, Q61R) was identified in various specimens from patients with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis. However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

Cells were mixed at the indicated ratios and tube formation assays were performed. NRASWT HDLECs showed well-regulated lumen structures and tube formation, but NRASQ61R HDLECs exhibited sheet-like proliferation and the formation of capillary-like structures was markedly less than that of NRASWT HDLECs. The higher the proportion of NRASQ61R HDLECs (fluorescent cells), the greater the sheet-like proliferation and the fewer the capillary-like structures.  2B: In the stepwise examination of NRASQ61R HDLEC mixtures, the covered area (occupied area by cellular components) (a), total nets (number of nets) (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) were analyzed by WinTube. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SD from triplicate wells. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, compared with 0%.  2C: Covered area (a), total nets (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) of NRASQ61R HDLECs with or without treatment were analyzed by WinTube.

Briefly, CE-TOFMS and CE-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent CE capillary electrophoresis system equipped with an Agilent 6210 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Agilent 6460 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (Agilent Technologies), respectively. The systems were controlled by Agilent G2201AA ChemStation software version B.03.01 for CE (Agilent Technologies) and connected by a fused silica capillary (50 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 80 cm total length) with commercial electrophoresis buffer (H3301-1001 and I3302-1023 for cation and anion analyses, respectively, at HMT) as the electrolyte. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 50 to 1,000 (Ohashi et al., 2008)11 and the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to detect compounds in dynamic MRM mode. Peaks were extracted using MasterHands, automatic integration software (Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan) (Sugimoto et al., 2009)13 and MassHunter Quantitative Analysis B.04.00 (Agilent Technologies) to obtain peak information including m/z, peak area and migration time (MT). Signal peaks were annotated in accordance with HMT\u2019s metabolite database based on their m/z values and MTs. The peak area of each metabolite was normalized to internal standards, and metabolite concentration was evaluated by standard curves with three-point calibrations using each standard compound. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis (Yamamoto et al., 2014)14 were performed by HMT\u2019s proprietary MATLAB and R programs, respectively. Detected metabolites were plotted on metabolic pathway maps using VANTED software (Junker et al., 2006)15."

The Lenti-X 293 T cell line was spread on 10-cm plates at a density 5.0 \u00d7 106 cells per plate and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 24 h. The pLVSIN-EF1\u03b1-AcGFP-C1 vector (5.5 \u03bcg) was added to 7 \u03bcL Lentiviral Mix High Titer Packaging Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), 1500 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM, and 45 \u03bcL Trans IT-293 Transfection Reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). After 15 min, this mixture was added to Lenti-X 293 T cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM. After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (this solution contained recombinant lentiviruses). HDLECs were spread onto six-well plates at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The recombinant lentiviral solution was diluted with EBM2 to give solutions with initial concentrations of 1:4 to 1:10. The medium was discarded from each well, and 2 ml of the recombinant lentiviral solutions were added to each well. Polybrene was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. To select stably GFP-only or C-terminal GFP-fused NRASQ61R cells, repeated exchange of the medium and the addition of puromycin (final concentrations of 1.5 \u03bcg/m and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) were performed every 72 h. NRASQ61R expression in these cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GFP gene was transfected into HDLECs by the same method.

    "description": "In Drosophila male gonads, niche-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has a role in maintaining stem cells in close proximity but the range of Dpp diffusion and its role has never been tested in the differentiating cells spaced one-cell layer away. Here, using genetically encoded nanobodies called Morphotraps, we physically block Dpp diffusion without interfering with niche-stem cell signaling and find that a diffusible fraction of Dpp is required to ensure differentiation of GSC daughter cells, opposite of its role in maintenance of GSC in the niche. Our work provides an example in which a soluble niche ligand induces opposed cellular responses in stem cells versus differentiating descendants to ensure spatial control of the niche, which may be a common mechanism to regulate tissue homeostasis.",

    "release_date": "2024-02-21",
    "description": "The tight control of fate transitions during stem cell differentiation is essential for proper\ntissue development and maintenance. However, identifying how the multilayered regulation\nof gene expression programmes orchestrates stem cell differentiation in vivo remains\nelusive, because of the challenges in studying sparsely distributed adult stem cells in a\nsystematic manner. Here, we synchronised Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC)\ndifferentiation in vivo to perform in-depth transcriptome and translatome analyses at high\ndevelopmental resolution. This characterisation revealed widespread and dynamic changes\nin mRNA level, promoter usage, exon inclusion, and translation efficiency. Transient\nexpression of the master regulator, Bam, drives a first wave of expression changes, primarily\nmodifying the cell cycle programme. Surprisingly, as Bam levels recede, differentiating cells\nreturn to a remarkably stem cell-like transcription and translation programme, with a few\ncrucial changes feeding into a second phase driving terminal differentiation to form the\noocyte. Altogether, these findings reveal that rather than a unidirectional accumulation of\nchanges, the in vivo differentiation programme relies on distinctly regulated and\ndevelopmentally sequential waves.",

    "description": "The functional importance of nuclear protein condensation remains often unclear. The bHLH FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) controls iron acquisition and growth in plants. Previously described C-terminal serine residues allow FIT to interact and form active transcription factor complexes with subgroup Ib bHLH factors such as bHLH039. FIT has lower nuclear mobility than mutant FITmSS271AA. Here, we show that FIT undergoes a light-inducible subnuclear partitioning into FIT nuclear bodies (NBs). Using quantitative and qualitative microscopy-based approaches, we characterized FIT NBs as condensates that were reversible and likely formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. FIT accumulated preferentially in NBs versus nucleoplasm when engaged in protein complexes with itself and with bHLH039. FITmSS271AA, instead, localized to NBs with different dynamics. FIT colocalized with splicing and light signaling NB markers. The NB-inducing light conditions were linked with active FIT and elevated FIT target gene expression in roots. FIT condensation may affect nuclear mobility and be relevant for integrating environmental and Fe nutrition signals.",

Correct scale was set (in \u00b5m) under \u2018Properties\u2019. Parameters that should be quantified were selected under \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u2018Set 3D Measurements\u2019. To perform the analysis, \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u20183D object counter\u2019 was selected. Threshold for the intensity limit (areas below that limit were not considered for quantification) was set manually for every z-stack. Calculated values were further processed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Only size between 0,01-15 \u00b5m\u00b3 was considered. The reason for preferring manual versus automatic image adjustments is as follows: FIT NBs were numerous with varying size and signal intensity. We had found that a fixed threshold for intensity within the ImageJ software caused a loss of NBs when present but below the set threshold. To avoid this, manual inspection was preferred when using the ImageJ software to segment correctly."

(2010). Cultures of Rhizobium radiobacter containing the construct of interest were incubated overnight and cell were pelleted and dissolved in AS medium (250 \u00b5M acetosyringone (in DMSO), 5 % (w/v) sucrose, 0.01 % (v/v) silwet, 0.01 % (w/v) glucose). An OD600nm of 0.4 was set for all constructs. A Rhizobium radiobacter strain containing the silencing repressor p19 vector (Shamloul et al., 2014) was used additionally for bHLH039-mCherry to enhance expression. After 1 h incubation on ice the suspension was infiltrated with a syringe into the abaxial side of the leaf. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were kept under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) in the laboratory after infiltration. Imaging was performed 2-3 d after infiltration. Expression of constructs with an inducible 35S promoter was induced 16 h prior to imaging with \u03b2-estradiol (20 \u00b5M \u03b2-estradiol (in DMSO), 0.1 % (v/v) Tween 20). In total, 3-4 differently aged leaves of 2 plants were infiltrated and used for imaging. One infiltrated leaf with homogenous presence of one or two fluorescence proteins was selected, depending on the aim of the experiment.\nStandardized FIT NB analysis procedure:\nFollowing Nicotiana benthamiana leaf infiltration with Rhizobium radiobacter, protein expression was induced after 2-3 d by \u03b2-estradiol, as described above. 16 h later, a leaf disc was excised and fluorescence signals were recorded (t=0).

(2010). Cultures of Rhizobium radiobacter containing the construct of interest were incubated overnight and cell were pelleted and dissolved in AS medium (250 \u00b5M acetosyringone (in DMSO), 5 % (w/v) sucrose, 0.01 % (v/v) silwet, 0.01 % (w/v) glucose). An OD600nm of 0.4 was set for all constructs. A Rhizobium radiobacter strain containing the silencing repressor p19 vector (Shamloul et al., 2014) was used additionally for bHLH039-mCherry to enhance expression. After 1 h incubation on ice the suspension was infiltrated with a syringe into the abaxial side of the leaf. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were kept under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) in the laboratory after infiltration. Imaging was performed 2-3 d after infiltration. Expression of constructs with an inducible 35S promoter was induced 16 h prior to imaging with \u03b2-estradiol (20 \u00b5M \u03b2-estradiol (in DMSO), 0.1 % (v/v) Tween 20). In total, 3-4 differently aged leaves of 2 plants were infiltrated and used for imaging. One infiltrated leaf with homogenous presence of one or two fluorescence proteins was selected, depending on the aim of the experiment.\nStandardized FIT NB analysis procedure:\nFollowing Nicotiana benthamiana leaf infiltration with Rhizobium radiobacter, protein expression was induced after 2-3 d by \u03b2-estradiol, as described above. 16 h later, a leaf disc was excised and fluorescence signals were recorded (t=0). The leaf disc was excited with 488 nm laser light for 1 min. 5 min later, accumulation in NBs was observed (t= 5 min). This procedure was modified by using different time points (t=5/15) for NB analysis and different constructs and co-expression.",

    "title": "Beta-cell Intrinsic Dynamics Rather than Gap Junction Structure Dictates Subpopulations in the Islet Functional Network",
    "release_date": "2024-01-22",
    "description": "Diabetes is caused by the inability of electrically coupled, functionally heterogeneous \u03b2-cells within the pancreatic islet to provide adequate insulin secretion. Functional networks have been used to represent synchronized oscillatory [Ca2+] dynamics and to study \u03b2-cell subpopulations, which play an important role in driving islet function. The mechanism by which highly synchronized \u03b2-cell subpopulations drive islet function is unclear. We used experimental and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between functional networks, structural (gap-junction) networks, and intrinsic \u03b2-cell dynamics in slow and fast oscillating islets. Highly synchronized subpopulations in the functional network were differentiated by intrinsic dynamics, including metabolic activity and KATP channel conductance, more than structural coupling. Consistent with this, intrinsic dynamics were more predictive of high synchronization in the islet functional network as compared to high levels of structural coupling. Finally, dysfunction of gap junctions, which can occur in diabetes, caused decreases in the efficiency and clustering of the functional network. These results indicate that intrinsic dynamics rather than structure drive connections in the functional network and highly synchronized subpopulations, but gap junctions are still essential for overall network efficiency. These findings deepen our interpretation of functional networks and the formation of functional sub-populations in dynamic tissues such as the islet.\u2003",

    "description": "During asymmetric cell division, cell polarity is coordinated with the cell cycle to allow proper inheritance of cell fate determinants and generation of cellular diversity. In the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) zygote, polarity is governed by evolutionarily conserved Partitioning (PAR) proteins that segregate to opposing cortical domains to specify asymmetric cell fates. Timely establishment of PAR domains requires a cell cycle kinase, Aurora A (AIR-1 in C. elegans). Aurora A depletion by RNAi causes a spectrum of phenotypes including reversed polarity,  excess posterior domains, and no posterior domain. How depletion of a single kinase can cause seemingly opposite phenotypes remains obscure. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system and drug treatments, we found that AIR-1 regulates polarity differently at different times of the cell cycle. During meiosis I, AIR-1 acts to prevent later formation of bipolar domains, while in meiosis II, AIR-1 is necessary to recruit PAR-2 onto the membrane. Together these data clarify the origin of multiple polarization phenotypes in RNAi experiments and reveal multiple roles of AIR-1 in coordinating PAR protein localization with cell cycle progression.

    "release_date": "2024-03-30",
    "description": "Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient needed in many metabolic processes. To balance needs and potential toxicity, plants control the amount of Fe they take up and allocate to leaves and seeds during their development. One important regulator of this process is POPEYE (PYE). PYE is a Fe deficiency-induced key bHLH transcription factor (TF) for allocation of internal Fe in plants. In the absence of PYE, there is altered Fe translocation and plants develop a leaf chlorosis. NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE4 (NAS4), FERRIC-REDUCTION OXIDASE3 (FRO3), and ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR1 (ZIF1) genes are expressed at higher level in pye-1 indicating that PYE represses these genes. PYE activity is controlled in a yet unknown manner. Here, we show that a small Fe deficiency-induced protein OLIVIA (OLV) can interact with PYE. OLV has a conserved C-terminal motif, that we named TGIYY. Through deletion mapping, we pinpointed that OLV TGIYY and several regions of PYE can be involved in the protein interaction. An OLV overexpressing (OX) mutant line exhibited an enhanced NAS4 gene expression. This was a mild Fe deficiency response phenotype that was related to PYE function. Leaf rosettes of olv mutants remained smaller than those of wild type, indicating that OLV promotes plant growth. Taken together, our study identified a small protein OLV as a candidate that may connect aspects of Fe homeostasis with regulation of leaf growth.",

    "description": "Redox homeostasis modulates the morphology of cardiomyocytes\nRedox homeostasis is affected in heart failure. Remodelling of heart failure has been associated with enhanced ROS production due to alterations in the excitation-contraction coupling, or due to altered cytoplasmic calcium handling (M\u00fcnzel, Gori et al. 2015). However, these alterations are met by adaptations of the antioxidative system to restore redox homeostasis. We have noted that redox induces changes to cardiomyocytes geometry, where oxidative stress induces cardiomyocytes\u2019 elongation and atrophy, while antioxidative compounds promotes cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. These alterations in the cardiomyocyte\u2019s geometry resemble the changes observed to geometry of the heart during heart failure and indicate that intracellular redox homeostasis is involved in regulating the morphology of cardiomyocytes. We quantitatively measured these alterations in cell morphology upon treating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with a pro-oxidant (Sulforaphane, SF) and an antioxidant (N-Acetyl Cysteine, NAC). We utilized florescence microscopic imaging, followed by image analysis with ImageJ. This experiment is part of a study that investigates the impact of endogenous antioxidative defenses in the heart and the potentially adverse effects associated with excessive quenching of physiological levels of reactive oxygen species, which act as cellular signalling molecules. The study is now available as a pre-pint on BioRxiv (Epigenetic modulators link mitochondrial redox homeostasis to cardiac function a sex-dependent manner, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.26.485908), and under consideration for publication in Nature Communications.",

In short, we developed an unbiased approach to profile the shape of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in Fiji 60. The \u03b1-actinin channel was utilized for segmentation. The workflow consisted of a pre-processing step in which the median filter was applied to the input images in order to reduce noise. Then, the images were segmented using the Li\u2019s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method. To avoid any bias in quantifying segmented cardiomyocytes between different treatments, we excluded all cropped cells that were on the images\u2019 edges. We also excluded segmented particles with an area smaller than 50000 pixels.\nTo quantify the changes in cell shape upon treatments, we utilized the minimum caliper diameter (MinFeret shape descriptor in Fiji), which measures the smallest diameter between any two points at the boundary of a segmented object. We also utilized the area of the segmented objects to visualize changes in cardiomyocytes\u2019 size upon different treatments. However, NRCMs in 2D culture acquire a variety of random shapes and sizes, and the diversity in the shapes and sizes were further greatly enhanced by the SF and NAC treatments, which also affected the identifications of contiguous cells\u2019 boundaries. This fact made it impossible to segment all individual cardiomyocytes, especially in the NAC treatment, where cells were hypertrophied and more intertwined. This problem was not even possible to resolve by manual curation of cells\u2019 borders or by staining the cytoplasmic membrane. As our interest was to quantify the changes in cell area and diameter between different treatments, we segmented connected cells as one object. We segmented 6 images from the control group, and 8 images from each of SF and NAC treatments. The segmentation resulted in 123-196 objects per image. For each object of each image, we computed the area and minimum diameter. To plot them, we pooled the measures of each condition together. Pooling them resulted in groups of values, in which each value originated from one image (6 for the control condition,8 for NAC and 8 for SF treatments). Then we calculated the average of each group. This resulted in 148 objects in the control condition, 144 objects in the NAC treatment, and 196 objects in the SF treatment as shown in the Source Data File. These averaged values of the segmented objects\u2019 area and MinFeret were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The implemented image analysis pipeline is available in Github (https://github.com/BIIFSweden/CellGeometryProfiling)."

After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS to remove dead cells and incubated for another 48 h with maintenance medium (similar composition of the CM plating medium but supplemented with 2.5 \u00b5M of the mitotic inhibitor cytarabine, (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)). Cells were then treated with sulforaphane  (SF, 5\u00b5M) or N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 3 mM)  (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) for 72 h. The maintenance medium was changed every 24 h with fresh supplements of SF or NAC.\n\nTreated NRCMs  in 6-well plate with a plastic bottom were fixed with 4% buffered formalin. Cells were washed with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT and blocked with a blocking buffer (1% BSA, 22.52 mg/ml glycine and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 30 min at RT. The primary antibody (mouse anti-\u03b1-actinin antibodies A7811, Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted with an incubation buffer (1%BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS,1:1000) and incubated overnight at 4oC. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated antibody ab175473, Abcam) were diluted with incubation buffer (1:1000) and incubated for 1h at RT. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS after each step. Widefield images were acquired as described in the following section.",

For initial polyclonal and monoclonal cell lines selection, after aspirating culture media, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. Cells were then mounted onto glass slides with EverBrite mounting medium with DAPI (Biotium Cat #23002), and ready for imaging. For the final monoclonal cell line characterization, the localization of all spatial APEX2 constructs were determined by the co-localization analysis with subcellular location markers. Cells were first washed with PBS twice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT). After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT and blocked in 5% BSA (w/v) in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 1h at RT. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS-T against GFP (1:500) and Vimentin (1:100) for NES, GFP (1:500) and E-cadherin (1:500) for Lyn11, Rab 5 (1:200) for 2xFYVE , Rab9 (1:200) for LAMTOR1 and LAMP1, Golgin-97 (1:200) for GalT, and Alexa 647-conjugated M1-anti-FLAG antibody (1:200) for 5HT2A was performed at 4 oC overnight. After washing with PBS-T three times, cells were incubated with AF488-labeled goat anti-Chicken, AF555-labeled goat anti-Mouse, and AF647-labeled goat anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS-T (1:1000) for 1 hour at RT. Cells were then washed in PBS-T twice and one final wash in PBS, mounted onto glass slides using EverBrite mounting medium with DAPI (Biotium Cat #23002), and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Images were generated using a Nikon Ti2-E microscope equipped with a Crest X-Light-V2 spinning disk confocal (Crest Optics), emission filters, 438/24 (DAPI), 511/20 (GFP), 560/25 (RFP), and 685/40 (Cy5), and Celeste Light Engine excitation lasers 405/477/546/638 nm used respectively (Lumencor), Piezo stage (Mad City Labs), and a Prime 95B 25mm CMOS camera (Photometrics) using a Plan Apo VC 100x/1.4 Oil (Nikon).

This selection was made by the certified pathologists at the National Center for Tumor Diseases' Tissue Bank and the University Hospital Heidelberg's Institute of Pathology as previously described41. Two 4.5 mm cores per patient were incorporated into Tissue Microarrays (TMAs). TMA sections (4 \u03bcm) were affixed to Vectabond-precoated 25 x 25 mm coverslips, coated with paraffin, and stored for future staining.\n\nAntibody conjugation, validation, and titration:\n\nWe used the co-detection by indexing (CODEX) approach for multicolor immunofluorescence21. Antibodies utilized for CODEX experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. We reduced purified, carrier-free antibodies with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and conjugated them with maleimide-modified CODEX DNA oligonucleotides, procured from TriLink Biotechnologies. A board-certified pathologist supervised the evaluation of the conjugated antibodies in singleplex stains on tonsil and/or lymphoma tissue, comparing with online databases, immunohistochemical reference stains, and published literature. We validated staining patterns in multiplex experiments with positive and negative control antibodies and titrated the appropriate dilution of each antibody starting from 1:100 to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nMultiplex tissue staining and fixation:\n\nWe deparaffinized, and rehydrated coverslips, and subjected them to heat-induced epitope retrieval at pH9 and 97\u00b0C for 10 minutes in a Lab Vision PT module. After blocking non-specific binding with CODEX FFPE blocking solution, we stained the coverslips overnight with the full antibody panel. Following staining, coverslips were fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde, methanol, and BS3 fixative, then stored in CODEX buffer S4 until imaging.\n",

Xist expression was induced either 2 or 6 days prior to fixation, with dTAG-13 added to degrade YY1 52 h prior to fixation. . At collection, cells on coverslips were washed once with PBS, fixed in the 6-well plate with 3% formaldehyde (pH7) for 10 min, then washed once with PBS, twice with PBST.5 (0.05% Tween20 in PBS), and transferred into a new 6-well dish for permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT. After three further PBST.5 washes, cells on cover slips were subjected to ethanol dehydration by an initial incubation with 70% EtOH (for 30 min at RT), then progressive exchanges to 80%, 90% and finally 100% EtOH. Xist FISH probe was prepared from an 18 kb cloned cDNA (pBS_Xist) spanning the whole Xist transcript using a Nick translation kit (Enzo Biosciences). The FISH hybridisation mix consisted of: 3 \u03bcL Texas Red-labelled Xist probe (~50 ng DNA), 1 \u03bcL 10 mg/mL Salmon Sperm DNA, 0.4 \u03bcL 3M NaOAc and 3 volumes of 100% EtOH per sample. This was precipitated by centrifugation (20,000 g for 20 min at 4oC), washed with 70% EtOH, air-dried, then resuspended in 6 \u03bcL deionised formamide (Merck Life Science) per hybridisation and incubated in a shaker (1400 rpm) at 42oC for at least 30 min. 2X hybridisation buffer (4X SSC, 20% dextran sulphate, 2 mg/mL BSA (NEB), 1/10 volume nuclease free water and 1/10 volume vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex (VRC; pre-warmed at 65oC for 5 min before use)) was denatured at 75oC for 5 min, placed back on ice to cool, then mixed with hybridization mix. Each coverslip was hybridised with 30 \u03bcL probe/hybridisation mix in a humid box at 37oC overnight. The next day, coverslips were washed 3 times for 5 min at 42oC with pre-warmed 50% formamide/2X saline-sodium citrate buffer (1/10 20X SSC in PBST.5), then subjected to further washes (3 x 2XSSC, 1 x PBST.5, 1 x PBS, each for 5 min using a 42oC hot plate) before being mounted with VECTASHIELD plus DAPI (Vector Labs) onto Superfrost Plus microscopy slides (VWR).

Gribnau).\nmESCs were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS; ThermoFisher), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin/ 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (all from Life Technologies) and 1000 U/mL LIF (made in-house). Cells were grown on gelatin-coated plates under standard cell culture conditions (37oC, 5% CO2, humid) on a \u2018feeder\u2019 layer of SNLP mouse fibroblasts mitotically inactivated by Mitomycin-C (Sigma Aldrich). mESCs were routinely passaged at ~80% confluency every 2-3 days using TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher). Before experiments, feeder cells were removed by pre-plating to gelatinised cell culture dishes for 30-40 min, with slower-attaching mESCs taken from suspension and plated to new gelatinised dishes.\nXist expression from the TetOn promoter was induced by addition of 1\u00b5g/ml doxycycline (Sigma, D9891). dTAG-13 (Tocris, #6605) was applied to FKBP12F36V-fusion cell lines at 100 nM to induce protein degradation."

    "description": "Although mitochondrial morphology changes have been consistently associated with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ageing, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms at play have remained somewhat obscure. Using a live-cell super-resolution (SR) microscopy technique, we have been able to identify different HSCs subsets that feature mitochondria of distinct morphologies and spatial distributions. Integrating SR microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled us to classify approximately two hundred HSCs from both young and aged mice into five discrete clusters. These clusters show molecular profiles that mirror the varying states of mitochondria. Our integrated approach of RNA biomarker analysis and potential regulon assessment has unveiled hitherto unrecognized functions of GDF15 in mediating mitochondrial signals and morphologies that direct HSCs fate. Therefore, the combination of SR imaging with bioinformatics pipeline offers a notably effective method for the identification of critical molecular players in specific phases of cellular transition, utilizing a relatively small dataset.

    "description": "Fast, accurate and affordable bacterial identification methods are paramount for timely treatment of infections, especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). However, today only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach by the acquisition and the subsequent analysis comprising 257 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and inter- species variability, a scenario more akin to the real-world clinical practice rather than the one achievable solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite the variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7 %. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.",

The image sensor is a full frame (36.0 mm \u00d7 24.0 mm) back-illuminated Bayer CMOS sensor, with 62.4 million pixels: an array of 9 520 \u00d7 6 328 pixels at 3.8 \u00b5m pitch. We designed and manufactured the electronic system to operate this sensor. The Petri dish is set directly on the sensor and illuminated from above by the illumination module. That module consists of two monochromatic light sources coupled into a multimode optical fibre via a Y fiber SMA (Thorlabs BFY105LS02): a green LED (550 nm) Thorlabs MINTF4 and a near-infrared LED (940 nm) Thorlabs M940F3.",

All the images were collected on isolates growing on BD\u2122 Mueller Hinton (MH) II Agar (Becton Dickinson, ref. 254081) after 20 hours of growth at 36\u00b0C in a conventional Heratherm incubator (Thermo Scientific, ref. 51028130). \n\nAs far as blood cultures are concerned, as they are mainly monomicrobial, the imaged MH plates were directly inoculated from positive blood cultures. Only aerobic and paediatric bottles were used, namely BD BACTEC\u2122 Plus Aerobic/F (Becton Dickinson, ref. 442023) and BD BACTEC\u2122 Peds Plus/F (Becton Dickinson, ref. 442194). We set a maximum delay of 72 h between positivity and streaking of the MH plate, by a BD Kiestra\uf0d4 automated plate streaking system (Becton Dickinson). We highlight that we willingly chose dilution factors that led to high colony densities, in order to reproduce true field usage of the system. Indeed, when dealing with unknown species, dilution is necessarily species-agnostic and is set such that all tested samples yield a sufficient number of colonies, and consequently many samples show very high colony densities. \n\nAs far as the other samples are concerned (urine/genital tract, wound/skin and respiratory specimens), clinical isolates were first grown on an isolation plate, either on a Mac Conkey agar or on a blood-supplemented medium such as Columbia agar. Then a colony of a specific species, picked from the isolation plate, was resuspended in a suspension broth. Optical density was checked before diluting and finally plating on MH agar. ",

For standard 4-color imaging, laser power and gain were adjusted manually to give optimal fluorescence for each fluorophore with minimal photobleaching. Images were captured using the ZEN Imaging Software and processed in Fiji (ImageJ v1.53). \n\nsmRNA-FISH: images were acquired using a LSM880 confocal microscope with an Airyscan system. The Airyscan system has 32-channel GaAsP (Gallium Arsenide Phosphide) detectors, which allow to obtain images with enhanced spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than in traditional LSM systems (Huff 2015). A 63x/1,4 OIL DICII PL APO objective was used. Images were processed in Fiji (ImageJ v1.53).\n\nLive imaging: time-lapse images were acquired using an LSM780 or LSM880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 10x/0,3 DICI EC PL NEOFLUAR, for imaging at the tissue scale. Explants were cultured in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 during imaging. To analyze branching morphogenesis in embryonic mammary buds, images were acquired at 8 mm Z intervals over approximately 80 mm thickness and 60 min intervals for 12-48 hr.\n",

Mikkola (Voutilainen, Lindfors, and Mikkola 2013).\n\nMammary cultures wholemount immunostaining \nWhole-mount immunostaining of embryonic tissue explants was performed as previously described (Caraba\u00f1a and Lloyd-Lewis 2022). Explants were transferred to 24-well plates, washed in PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 2 hr at RT. After a blocking step in PBS containing 5% FBS, 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 1% Triton x-100 (Euromedex, 2000-C) for 2 hr, explants were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, with secondary Alexa-fluor conjugated antibodies and DAPI (10uM) diluted in PBS for 5 hr at RT. Ex vivo cultures were mounted in a slide using Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences, 18606). \nThe following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-SMA (1:300, Abcam, ab5694), rat anti-K8 (1:300, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone TROMA-I), mouse anti-P63 (1:300, Abcam, ab735), rabbit anti-K5 (1:300, Covance, PRB-160P-100), rat anti-ZO-1 (1:100, Millipore, MABT11), rabbit anti-K14 (1:300, ab181595).\nEdU incorporation was visualized using Click-It chemistry (Invitrogen) by incubating ex vivo cultures for 2 hr with EdU solution (10 \u03bcM). EdU was then detected with freshly made Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10640), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342 (10 \u03bcg/mL) for 30 minutes at RT. \n\nImmunostaining on 2D sections \nEmbryos were harvested and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by another overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in 30% sucrose. Then, embryos were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound and 7 \u03bcm-thick cryosections were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM1950). After a blocking step in PBS containing 5% FBS, 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton x-100 for 2 hr, sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber, then with secondary Alexa-fluor conjugated antibodies and DAPI (10uM) diluted in PBS for 2 hr at RT. Finally, sections were mounted in a slide using Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences, 18606). \nThe following primary antibodies were used: rat anti-K8 (1:300, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone TROMA-I), mouse anti-P63 (1:300, Abcam, ab735), mouse anti-ERalpha (1:20, Agilent-Dako, M7047), rabbit anti-K5 (1:300, Covance, PRB-160P-100), rabbit anti-PLAG1 (1:100) (Spengler et al. 1997) and rabbit anti-LEF1 (1:100, Cell Signaling).\n\nOptical tissue clearing and wholemount immunostaining \nMammary gland at E17.5 and at birth were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Optical tissue clearing was performed as previously described (Lloyd-Lewis et al. 2016). Briefly, tissues were immersed in CUBIC Reagent 1A (urea (10% w/w), Quadrol (5% w/w), triton X-100 (10% w/w) in distilled water) for 2 days at 37\u00b0C, washed in PBS and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing BSA (10%) and triton X-100 (0.5%). Tissues were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C for 3 days with gentle agitation. Then, the samples were washed in PBS 3 times for 1 hr each and incubated with secondary Alexa-fluor conjugated antibodies and DAPI (10uM) diluted in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 2 days with gentle agitation. Tissues were imaged in CUBIC Reagent 2 (sucrose (50% w/v), thiethanolamine (10% w/v), triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) in distilled water). The following primary antibodies were used: rat anti-K8 (1:300, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone TROMA-I), rabbit anti-PH3 (1:300, Millipore). \n\nSingle molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH)\nsmRNA-FISH was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. In brief, tissue cryosections were pre-treated with the target retrieval reagent (ACD, 322000) for 5 minutes and digested with Protease III (ACD, 322381) at 40\u00b0C for 15 minutes, before hybridization with the target oligonucleotide probes. Probe hybridization, amplification and binding of dye-labelled probes were performed sequentially. For subsequent immunostaining, sections were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% FBS and 2% BSA) for 1 hr. For smRNA-FISH in ex vivo explant cultures, the blocking buffer also included 0,3% Triton x-100 (Euromedex, 2000-C) to allow tissue permeabilization. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer was performed overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber, then secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted in PBS were added for 2 hr at RT. The experiments were performed on at least three different embryos for each probe. Slides were mounted in ProLong Diamond Anti-fade Mountant (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930) for imaging. The following RNAscope probes were used: Mm-Anxa1-C2 (ACD, 509291), Mm-Lgals3-C2 (ACD, 461471), Mm-Plet1-C1 (ACD, 557941), Mm-Ly6d-C1 (ACD, 532071), Mm-Cxcl14-C3 (ACD, 459741), Mm-Ndnf-C2 (ACD, 447471), Mm-Pthlh-C3 (ACD, 456521), Mm-Cd74-C1 (ACD, 437501), Mm-Vcan (ACD, 486231), Mm-Cdkn1c-C2 (ACD, 458331), Mm-Crabp1-C3 (ACD, 474711), 3-plex Positive Control Probe-Mm (ACD, PN 320881) and 3-plex Negative Control Probe (ACD, PN 320891). \n",

Mikkola (Voutilainen, Lindfors, and Mikkola 2013). Mammary embryonic buds were established in ex vivo culture as previously detailed in (Caraba\u00f1a and Lloyd-Lewis 2022). Collected embryonic mammary tissue was placed on a cell culture insert floating on embryonic culture medium into a 35 mm cover glass-bottomed tissue culture dish (Fluorodish, 81158). Embryonic culture medium is DMEM/F-12 (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21331020) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050-038), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (v/v), 20 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122) and 75 \u03bcg/mL Ascorbic acid (Sigma, A4544). Mammary cultures were maintained in a tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The culture media was replaced every two days. For growth factor assays, 1 nM FGF10 (Bio-techne, 6224-FG) was added to the medium at day 4. For experiments using the FGFR inhibitor, mammary buds were collected from E13.5 female embryos and maintained in culture for 4 days, after which 50 nM BGJ398 (Selleckchem, S2183) or DMSO in control wells were added and renewed every two days until day 9 in culture.

    "title": "Characterization of the Disease-Causing Mechanism of KIF3B Mutations from Ciliopathy Patients",
    "release_date": "2024-04-12",
    "description": "The heterodimeric kinesin-2 motor (KIF3A/KIF3B with accessory protein KAP3) drives intraflagellar transport, essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary function. Three point mutations in the KIF3B subunit have recently been linked to disease in humans (E250Q and L523P) and Bengal cats (A334T) (Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2020). Patients display retinal atrophy and, in some cases, other ciliopathy phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism leading to disease is currently unknown. Here, we used Kif3a-/-;Kif3b-/- (knockout) 3T3 cells, which cannot make cilia, to characterize these mutations. While reexpression of KIF3B(E250Q) and KIF3B(L523P) did not rescue ciliogenesis, reexpression of wildtype or KIF3B(A334T), restored ciliogenesis to wildtype levels. Fluorescent tagging revealed that the E250Q mutant decorated microtubules and thus is a rigor mutation. The L523P mutation, in the alpha-helical stalk domain, surprisingly did not affect formation of the KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3 complex but instead impaired motility along microtubules. Lastly, expression of the A334T motor was reduced in comparison to all other conditions and displayed an impaired ability to disperse the Golgi complex when artificially linked to this high-load cargo. In summary, this work uses cell-based assays to elucidates the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations in the KIF3B subunit on the kinesin-2 holoenzyme.",

Microtubules were immunostained with a rabbit anti-\u03b2-tubulin (Abcam Cat# ab179513; RRID:AB_3073861; 1:1000) primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21244, RRID:AB_2535812; 1:500). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Biotium Cat# 40043; 1:10,000). Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# P36930) onto microscope slides (Fisher Scientific Cat# 12-544-7).",

Six hours later, they were transfected via Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 11668019) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty-six hours after transfection, crude lysates were collected as previously described (Engelke et al., 2016). Lysates were diluted in lysis buffer containing no Triton X-100 and protein concentration determined via Bradford assay (Pierce Cat# 23200). Twenty-five \u00b5g of total protein from each sample was boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes in 1x Laemmli buffer (Biorad Cat# 1610747) with 200 mM DTT (Sigma Cat# 43815) and loaded into a 7.5% TGX FastCast Acrylamide gel (Biorad Cat# 1610170) along with EZ-Run Prestained Rec Protein ladder (Fisher BioReagents Cat# BP36031 ). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen Cat# IB401002) using the Invitrogen iBlot gel transfer system. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies rabbit anti-KIF3B (Cell Signaling Technologies Cat# 13817; RRID:AB_2798321; 1:1000) and rabbit anti-\u03b2-tubulin (Abcam Cat# ab179513; RRID:AB_3073861; 1:200,000). Following three washes in block, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch Cat# 111-035-144; RRID:AB_2307391; 1:10,000). Following two washes in block and two washes in PBS, the signal was developed with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Biorad Cat# 1705060S).",

            "protocol_description": "Fiber network manufacturing\n\nPolystyrene fibers were manufactured using the non-electrospinning spinneret-based tunable engineered parameters (STEP) platform as previously reported [Nain 2009, Wang 2014]. Polystyrene of two different molecular weights (Agilent, Mw = 15 x 10^6 g/mol and Polystyrene Standard, Mw = 2.5 x 10^6 g/mol) was dissolved in xylene (Carolina Chemicals) to form polymeric solutions at 5% (w/w). Additionally, 20 uL of 1 mg/mL of BDP FL Maleimide dye (Lumiprobe) was added to the polymer solutions to get fluorescent fibers. Fibers were spun on hollow 5 x 5 mm metal scaffolds. The first layer of fibers deposited were large diameter fibers ~2 um (Mw = 15 x 10^6 g/mol) followed by an orthogonal layer of 200 nm (Mw = 2.5 x 10^6 g/mol) fibers with spacing varying from 7 to 20 um to achieve a variety of cell shapes (elongated on single fibers and parallel-shaped cells on two or more fibers) [Jana 2023, Jana 2022, Singh 2021]. Additionally, crosshatch networks of 200 nm fiber diameters were also prepared with spacing varying from 7 to 20 um [Padhi 2020, Jana2019] to achieve polygonal and kite-shaped cells on multiple fibers. The fiber networks were fused at junctions using a custom-built chemical fusing chamber.\n\nCell culture and seeding on fiber networks\n\n3T3 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Corning) supplemented with 10\\% fetal bovine serum (Corning) in T25 flasks (Thermo Scientific). The cells were grown in an incubator kept at 37C and 5% CO2. The nanofiber network scaffolds were tacked on a cover glass (VWR, 24 x 60mm No. 1.5) with the help of high-vacuum grease (Dow Corning). Next, the scaffolds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 10 minutes followed by Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS) washes (two times). Next, the scaffold was coated with 4 ug/mL bovine fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for at least one hour to promote cell adhesion. Cells were then seeded onto the scaffolds with a seeding density of 300,000 cells/mL and were allowed to spread onto the fibers for a few hours followed by the addition of 3 mL of media. Cells were allowed to further spread for an additional 24 hours before fixation.\n\nImmunostaining cells on fiber networks \n\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Santa Cruz Chemicals) for 15minutes. The cells were then washed with PBS two times and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution. Following two PBS washes the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum (Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes. Next, conjugated antibody Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin (1:100, Thermo Fisher) diluted in antibody dilution buffer was added to the cells. After one hour, the cells were washed with PBS (3x, 5 minutes each). The sample was then covered in 2 mL of Live Cell Imaging Media (Thermo Fisher) for imaging.",

    "description": "Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density. ",

For the whole embryos obtained previously (47) that are used in this study, the first and last 3rd cleavage divisions occur between 0 and 2 h from each other. To compare the timing of whole embryos and doublets, we used the mean delay between cleavage divisions of whole embryos as the time after 3rd cleavage.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the contact angle of cell-cell contacts in whole embryos and doublets. Using the angle tool, the equatorial plane in which two contacting cells are observed is chosen to manually measure the external contact angle. Data of compacting whole WT embryos are taken from freely available time lapse images obtained previously (47).\nTo measure the size of contacts on doublets, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure length of contact at its equatorial plane.\nTo measure the size of micropipettes, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure the inner diameter near the tip.\n\nImmunostaining\nDoublets are imaged and synchronized using the 3rd cleavage division from 4- to 8-cell stage before being fixed and stained.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the intensity of Cdh1 and filamentous actin (phalloidin) in doublets to determine their distribution (i) at the cell-cell contact vs the cell-medium interfaces, (ii) at the contact rim vs central disc and (iii) at the contact edge vs inner contact.\n(i) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact and cell-medium interface, we measured the intensity Icc at cell-cell contacts and intensities Icm1 and Icm2 at the free surface of contacting cells 1 and 2. A 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line is manually drawn at the equatorial plane of the cell doublet to measure the mean intensities Icc, Icm1 and Icm2 at the corresponding interfaces.\n(ii) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact rim and central disc, we measured the intensities Idisc and Iring, with the latter one defined as a 1 \u00b5m thick circle at the rim of the contact. A 4 \u00b5m wide rectangle is drawn along the cell-cell contact to project it along the z axis using 3D project and interpolation functions of FIJI. On the projection, a circle is manually drawn around the entire cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. A 2 \u00b5m smaller circle is then positioned onto the center of the cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. To calculate the mean intensity Idisc, the total intensity of the small circle is divided by its area. To calculate the mean intensity Iring, the total intensity of the small circle is subtracted to the one of the large circle, the resulting intensity is divided by the area of the large circle to which the area of the small circle is subtracted.\n(iii) To account for the potential influence of depth of imaging in the analysis of the ring enrichment, we also performed a 2D analysis of Cdh1 and actin reorganization at the contact. Using a circle of radius 1 \u00b5m centered on the edge of contact, we measure the intensities of signal at both contact edges Iedge1 and Iedge2 of the equatorial plane of contact. We then measure intensity along the inner part of the cell-cell contact Iinner contact (excluding the edges) using a 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line. We then calculate the ratio between the average Iedge1 and Iedge2 and the Iinner contact.\n"

The animal facilities are operated according to international animal welfare rules. \nEmbryos are isolated from superovulated female mice mated with male mice. Superovulation of female mice is induced by intraperitoneal injection of 5 international units (IU) pregnant mare\u2019s serum gonadotropin (Ceva, Syncro-part), followed by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (MSD Animal Health, Chorulon) 44-48 hours later. Embryos are recovered at E1.5 by flushing oviducts with 37\u00b0C FHM (Millipore, MR-122-D) using a modified syringe (Acufirm, 1400 LL 23). \nEmbryos are handled using an aspirator tube (Sigma, A5177-5EA) equipped with a glass pipette pulled from glass micropipettes (Blaubrand intraMark or Warner Instruments). \nEmbryos are placed in KSOM (Millipore, MR-107-D) or FHM supplemented with 0.1 % BSA (Sigma, A3311) in 10 \u03bcL droplets covered in mineral oil (Acros Organics). Embryos are cultured in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. \nTo remove the Zona Pellucida (ZP), embryos are incubated for 45-60 s in pronase (Sigma, P8811) at the 2- or 4-cell stage.\nTo dissociate blastomeres, 4-cell stage embryos without ZP are aspirated 1-3 times into a glass pipette of size larger than a 4-cell stage blastomere and smaller than the whole embryo (i.e. ~50-80 \u00b5m in diameter).\nFor imaging, embryos, dissociated 4-cell stage blastomeres or 8-cell stage doublets are placed in 3.5 or 5 cm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek). \n\nMouse lines \nMice are used from 5 weeks old on. \n(C57BL/6xC3H) F1 hybrid strain is used for wild type (WT). \nTo remove LoxP sites specifically in oocytes, Zp3-cre (Tg(Zp3-cre)93Knw) mice are used (44).\nTo generate mCdh1+/- embryos, Cdh1tm2kem mice are used (45) to breed Cdh1tm2kem/tm2kem; Zp3Cre/+ mothers with WT fathers.\nTo generate mCdh1EcNc/- embryos, Cdh1tm2kem mice are used (45) to breed Cdh1tm2kem/ tm2kem; Zp3Cre/+ mothers with Cdh1tm3.1Mpst/+ fathers (36). To genotype EcNc embryos, we used antibodies recognizing the extra- or intra-cellular domains of Cdh1, or the HA tag added to the EcNc (36).\n",

            "protocol_description": "We built a bespoke scanned temporal focusing (sTeFo) 2 photon microscope for fast volumetric in vivo Ca2+ imaging of large IC neuronal populations from awake mice. Technical details and detailed working principle are extensively described elsewhere (Prevedel et al., 2016)\u2060. The main difference with respect to the microscope design published by Prevedel et al. (2016) was a higher repetition laser (10 MHz, FemtoTrain, Spectra Physics). Laser power while scanning was kept below 191 mW, measured after the objective, to avoid heating the brain tissue excessively (Prevedel et al., 2016)\u2060. 470 \u03bcm2 fields of view were imaged at 128 px2 resolution and spaced in 15 \u03bcm z steps to cover 570 \u03bcm in depth (38 z steps) at a volume rate of 4.01 Hz. Artifacts produced by objective piezo z drive flyback were excluded from analysis.\n\tIn a typical imaging session, cranial window implanted mice were briefly (< 1 min) anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 for quick head fixation at a custom stage, slightly restraining their bodies inside a 5 cm diameter acrylic tube, and positioned under our custom 2P microscope. Mice fully recovered from the brief isoflurane anesthesia, showing a clear blinking reflex, whisking and sniffing behaviors and normal body posture and movements, immediately after head fixation. A pilot group of mice were habituated to the head fixed condition in daily 20 min sessions for 3 days, however we did not observe a marked contrast in the behavior of habituated versus unhabituated mice during our relatively short 25 min imaging sessions. In consequence imaging sessions never surpassed a maximum of 25 min, after which the mouse was returned to its home cage. Typically, mice were imaged a total of 2-11 times (sessions), one to three times a week. Volumetric imaging data was visualized and rendered using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012)\u2060. Motion correction was performed using NoRMCorre (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017)\u2060 on individual imaging planes from the volumetric datasets. jRGECO1a signal was extracted, denoised and neuropil corrected from each individual imaging plane using CaImAn (Giovannucci et al., 2019)\u2060. Spike probabilities were estimated using MLSpike (Deneux et al., 2016)\u2060. ",

            "protocol_description": "- Animals and ethics statement:\n\tThis work was performed in compliance to the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU) to minimize animal pain and discomfort. EMBL\u2019s committee for animal welfare and institutional animal care and use (IACUC) approved all experimental procedures under protocol number 2019-04-15RP. Experiments were performed on 7-16-week-old CBA/j mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories and housed in groups of 1-5 in makrolon type 2L cages on ventilated racks at room temperature and 50% humidity with a 12 hr light cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum.\n\n- Surgical procedures:\nFor microscopy:\n\tCranial window surgeries were performed on 7-8-week-old mice of either sex following procedures published elsewhere (Boffi et al., 2018)\u2060. Briefly, anesthesia consisted of a mixture of 40 \u00b5l fentanyl (0.1 mg/ml; Janssen), 160 \u00b5l midazolam (5 mg/ml; Hameln) and 60 \u00b5l medetomidin (1 mg/ml; Pfizer), dosed in 5 \u00b5l/g body weight and injected i.p.. Hair removal cream was used to remove the fur over the scalp of anesthetized mice and eye ointment was applied (Bepanthen, Bayer). 1% xylocain (AstraZeneca) was injected as preincisional anesthesia under the scalp. Prepared mice were then placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, model 963) with their bodies on a heating pad (37\u00b0C). The scalp was surgically removed to expose the dorsal cranium. The periosteum was removed with fine forceps and scissors to prepare the surface for cranial window implantation and stereotaxic delivery of viral vectors. Post-surgical pain relief was provided (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim) through s.c. injections (0.1 mg/ml, dosed 10\u03bcl/g body weight).\n\tThe Ca2+ indicator jRGECO1a (Dana et al., 2016)\u2060 was expressed in IC neurons through induction with AAV vectors (Addgene #100854-AAV1), which were stereotaxically delivered as follows. A 4mm diameter circular craniectomy centered over IC (~1mm posterior to lambda (34)\u2060) was produced using a dental drill (Microtorque, Harvard Apparatus) with care to avoid bleeding and damage of the dura, which was not removed and left intact. Stereotaxic injections were performed at the right IC (from bregma: -5.2 mm AP, 0.5 mm ML) with pulled glass pipettes lowered to depths of 300, 400 and 500 \u03bcm, at a rate of ~4ul/hr using a syringe. ~300nl were injected per site. After injection, the craniectomy was sealed with a round 4mm coverslip (~170\u03bcm thick, disinfected with 70% ethanol), with a drop of saline between the glass and the dura, and dental acrylic cement (Hager Werken Cyano Fast and Paladur acrylic powder). A head fixation bar was also cemented. The open skin wound was also closed with acrylic cement. At the end of the surgery anesthesia was antagonized with a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of 120 \u00b5l sterile saline, 800 \u00b5l flumazenil (0.1 mg/ml; Fresenius Kabi), and 60 \u00b5l atipamezole (5 mg/ml; Pfizer) dosed in 10 \u00b5l/g body weight. Mice were single housed after surgery and were allowed to recover for at least 4 weeks before imaging, providing time for Ca2+ indicator expression and for the inflammation associated with this surgery to resolve (Holtmaat et al., 2009)\u2060.\n\nFor electrophysiology:\n\tAcute craniectomy surgeries were performed on 7-15-week-old mice of either sex following procedures published elsewhere (Boffi et al., 2018)\u2060. Briefly, anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane (Baxter) in O2, and maintained at 1.5-2% with a flow rate of 0.4-0.6 LPM. Hair removal cream was used to remove the fur over the scalp, eye ointment was applied (Bepanthen, Bayer) and 1% xylocain (AstraZeneca) was injected under the scalp as preincisional anesthesia. Mice were set in the stereotaxic apparatus with their bodies on a heating pad (37\u00b0C) and their scalp and periosteum removed to expose the dorsal cranium. A custom made head bar was cemented to the exposed cranium, sealing the skin wound, with UV cured dental acrylic to reduce curing time (Loctite 4305 LC). A ~4mm diameter circular craniectomy centered over IC (~1mm posterior to lambda (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001)\u2060) was produced using a dental drill (Microtorque, Harvard Apparatus) with care to avoid bleeding and damage of the dura. The surface of the brain was kept moist at all times with sterile cortex buffer (mM: NaCl 125, KCl 5, Glucose 10, Hepes 10, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, pH 7.4). The dura was carefully ripped open at a small site over DCIC for electrode insertion, through an incision made with a sterile G27 needle. The dura was not completely removed and the rest was left intact. Post-surgical pain relief was provided (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim) through s.c. injections (0.1 mg/ml, dosed 10\u03bcl/g body weight).\n\t Craniectomy surgeries typically lasted 30 min since the induction of anesthesia, after which the mouse was allowed to recover headfixed at the recording setup (same as for Ca2+ imaging, see below). Typically ~5 minutes after isoflurane removal the mice displayed awake behaviors like whisking, blinking, grooming and body movements. The craniectomy was kept submerged in a well of cortex buffer throughout the experiment. We began recording at least 40 minutes after the mouse showed signs of being fully awake. During this period the neuropixel probe was inserted into the DCIC at 10mm/s rate using a micromanipulatior (Sutter MPC-385 system, coupled to a Sensapex uMp-NPH Neuropixel 1.0 probe holder). After insertion, neuropixel probes were allowed to settle in the tissue for 10 min. The metal  headbar was left exposed to the cortex buffer close to the edge of the craniectomy and was used as  reference.",

Image data were acquired in a 2x3 stack mosaic acquisition, including primary auditory and primary visual cortex and surrounding areas. Light sheet NA was set to 0.165 (minimum sheet thickness 3.4\u00b5m), with a sheet width of 40% (~1.2cm) and an exposure time of 97 ms. Laser power for the respective lasers were set to 7.5mW (488nm), 22.5mW (555nm), 3.25mW (640nm), 75mW (785nm). To minimize a potential bias from the optical system, all samples but one were scanned with light sheets from the right side. \n",

The folder contains images of the processing in regards to the complete image and separate images of individual ROIs. ROIs are represented as yellow contour. The orientation of the membranes was tracked (blue sticks) and their coherency was computed. Local coherencies were visualized as thin red sticks of a certain length and angle emphasized by background colour. Global coherencies where shown as thick red sticks. Density functions revealed the distribution of local coherencies and the resulting mean local coherency and global coherency. The directions of local coherencies within each ROI were plotted as polar histograms respecting the 180-degree-symmetry and showed the computed angle of the global coherency. ",

Subsequently, eyes were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) for light microscopy (LM) analysis at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Eyes were washed in PBS before the cornea was punctured with a 30 G x 0.5 needle. Cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous were removed with a pair of micro scissors and curved forceps. Remaining muscle tissue around the sclera was gently removed and the optic nerve cut as short as possible. \nAfter dissection, the eyecup containing sclera, choroid, RPE and retina was cryopreserved overnight at 4 \u00b0C in a 30% (weight/volume) sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) solution and embedded in optimal cutting medium (OCT, NEG50, Thermo Scientific) inside of Tissue-Tek Cryomolds. Samples were sectioned at 20 \u00b5m thickness using a CryoStarTM NX70 cryostat. Serial transverse sections were collected on SuperfrostTM Plus Adhesion Microscopy Slides, air-dried for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and stored at -70\u00b0C.\nSlides with sections for antibody staining were air-dried for 30 min and rehydrated in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. During rehydration slides were covered with ShandonTM coverplates and placed into ShandonTM SequenzaTM racks. Next, slides were incubated in blocking buffer (0.3 % Triton X100, 5 % Donkey or Goat Serum, and 1 % BSA (Serva GmBH, 11926.04) dissolved in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Peripherin2, Thermo Scientific, 1:200; S-opsin, Santa Cruz, sc-14363, 1:200; PNA, Vector Laboratories, B-1075, 1:1000; M-opsin, Millipore, AB5405, 1:1000) dissolved in blocking buffer at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The slides were kept at room temperature for 30 min and washed with PBS. Afterwards, the tissue was incubated with secondary antibodies (Donkey-Anti-Rabbit-Cy2, Jackson IR, 711-225-152; Donkey-Anti-Goat-Cy3, Jackson IR, 705-165-147; Donkey-Anti-Rabbit-Cy5, Jackson IR, 711-175-152; Straptavidin-Alexa-488, Invitrogen, S11223, all diluted 1:1000) and DAPI nuclear staining solution (1:5000) dissolved in PBS. Then, slides were washed extensively in PBS and water before mounting with AquaPolymount (Polyscience, 18606) and a 24x50 mm #1.5 coverslip. Finally, slides were stored at 4\u00b0C after air drying at room temperature in a dark place overnight. \n",

    "title": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches respiratory epithelia through goblet cell invasion in a microtissue model",
    "release_date": "2024-04-11",
    "description": "While commensal bacteria generally respect natural barriers of the human body, pathogens are able to breach epithelia, invade deeper tissue layers and cause life-threatening infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen, is a leading cause of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, with mortality rates up to 50% in mechanically ventilated patients1\u20133. Effective colonization and breaching of lung mucosa are hallmarks of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis4. Although virulence factors and behavioral strategies of P. aeruginosa have been described5,6, it has remained unclear how this pathogen disseminates on functional mucosal surfaces, how it avoids mucociliary clearance and how it invades the tissue barrier. Using fully differentiated human lung epithelia, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa efficiently spreads on the apical tissue surface before it breaches epithelia by preferentially invading mucus secreting goblet cells. Internalization leads to host cell death and expulsion and the formation of ruptures of the epithelial barrier. Rupture sites are rapidly colonized by extracellular bacteria through active chemotaxis, leading to increasing tissue damage and successful pathogen translocation to the unprotected basolateral side of the epithelium. We show that cell invasion is promoted by two Type-6 toxin secretion systems (T6SS), while Type-3 (T3SS) mediates cell death of infected goblet cells. T3SS mutants invade goblet cells normally, but internalized bacteria fail to trigger goblet cell expulsion and instead show unrestrained intracellular replication. While the effective shedding of infected host cells reveals potent tissue protection mechanisms, the discovery of an intracellular lifestyle of P. aeruginosa in pseudostratified human lung epithelia provides new entry points into investigating the intersection of antibiotic and immune mechanisms during lung infections. By demonstrating that P. aeruginosa uses a combination of specific virulence factors and collective behavior to invade goblet cells and breach the lung tissue barrier from within, these studies reveal novel mechanisms underlying lung infection dynamics under physiological conditions.

Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 104 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

    "description": "Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to cilia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for DLG1, a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, the retromer-associated protein SDCCAG3, IFT20 and polycystin-2 (PC2) were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 variant, p.T489R. Finally, biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling suggested that SDCCAG3 and IFT20 form a complex that associates, at least indirectly, with DLG1. Our work identifies a key role for DLG1 in regulating ciliary protein composition and suggests that ciliary dysfunction of the p.T489R DLG1 variant may contribute to CAKUT.  ",

After permeabilization in 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS, samples were blocked in 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum diluted in PBS (or diluted in 0.2% TritonX-100 for ADP-ribose) for 1 hour and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Samples were washed 3-5 times for at least 5 minutes in PBS, incubated with appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies (Thermo) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature, washed again and stained with DAPI (Thermo). The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and sealed with nail polish. Hydroxylamine (Sigma) treatment was performed after fixation and permeabilization of slides at 1M pH 7.0 for 1h at room temperature.",

The source to detector and source to object distances were set at 1519 mm and 940 mm respectively, which combined with a 3000 x 3000 dexels detector resulted in an isotropic voxel (edge) size of 86 \u03bcm. Acquisition was conducted using both horizontal and vertical field extension modes.  The horizontal field extension offsets the detector so only half the width of the sample is in field of view at any time. This allows for a sample that is wider than the detector to be imaged. This results in part (half) of the specimen being sampled during the initial 0 -180 degrees rotation, and the rest of the specimen scanned during the second 180 -360 degrees rotation, with an appropriate overlap (10-20%). The process was then repeated 3 times to cover the vertical height of the specimen, with overlaps to eliminate cone-beam beam artefacts. This gave a total scan time of approximately 1 hour 40 minutes. The collected radiographs are then combined in silico to provide the information required for the full field of horizontal view reconstruction by the diondo diControl software (v 1.9.1.62), and then the scans concatenated to provide the full vertical field of view. During the reconstruction ring artefact, bad pixel, beam hardening and truncation corrections were applied.",

    "description": "Astrocytic dysfunction has been previously described in Parkinson's, but the role of astrocytic gap junctional networks has not been explored. Connexin 43 is the major protein linking astrocytes in networks across the brain. In the present dataset, images from three cortical areas (parietal, frontal, and insular) and basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, midbrain substantia nigra) were collected from 20 people with Parkinson's and 20 age-matched controls to reveal downregulation in connexin 43 punctate staining in Parkinson's. Punctate pattern was specifically affected in disease, which may indicate dysfunction in gap junctional coupling.",

    "description": "The zebrafish Danio rerio has become a popular model host to explore disease pathology caused by infectious agents. A main advantage is its transparency at an early age, which enables live imaging of infection dynamics. While multispecies infections are common in patients, the zebrafish model is rarely used to study them, although the model would be ideal for investigating pathogen-pathogen and pathogen-host interactions. This may be due to the absence of an established multispecies infection protocol for a defined organ and the lack of suitable image analysis pipelines for automated image processing. To address these issues, we developed a protocol for establishing and tracking single and multispecies bacterial infections in the inner ear structure (otic vesicle) of the zebrafish by imaging. Subsequently, we generated an image analysis pipeline that involved deep learning for the automated segmentation of the otic vesicle, and scripts for the quantification of pathogen frequencies through fluorescence intensity measures. We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, three of the difficult-to-treat ESKAPE pathogens, to show that our infection protocol and image analysis pipeline work both for single pathogens and pairwise pathogen combinations. Thus, our protocols provide a comprehensive toolbox for studying single and multispecies infections in real-time in zebrafish.",

Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

For example, the tumour suppressor TP53/TRP53 can initiate diverse cellular responses by transcriptional activation of its target genes: Puma to induce apoptotic cell death and p21 to induce cell cycle arrest/cell senescence. However, it is not known how these processes are regulated and initiated in different cell types. To be able to examine this, we developed triple-FLAG TRP53 knock-in mice for TRP53 pull-down and two TRP53 response reporter mice, knocking tdTomato or GFP into the Puma/Bbc3 or p21 gene loci, respectively. By crossing the reporter mice onto a TRP53-deficient background, we could show that these reporters reliably inform on TRP53-dependent and TRP53-independent initiation of the apoptotic as well as the cell cycle arrest/senescence programs in vitro and even in vivo.

    "release_date": "2024-05-12",
    "description": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a prevalent neurological disorder that imposes a significant burden on children, families, and society worldwide. Recently, the RhoB p.S73F mutation was identified as a de novo mutation associated with CP. However, the mechanism by which the RhoB p.S73F mutation causes CP is currently unclear. In this study, rabbit models were generated to mimic the human RhoB p.S73F mutation using the SpG-BE4max system, and exhibited the typical symptoms of human CP, such as periventricular leukomalacia and spastic-dystonic diplegia. Further investigation revealed that the RhoB p.S73F mutation could activate ACAT1 through the LYN pathway, and the subsequently altered lipid levels may lead to neuronal and white matter damage resulting in the development of CP. This study presented the first mammalian model of genetic CP that accurately replicates RhoB p.S73F mutation in humans, provided further insights between RhoB and lipid metabolism, and novel therapeutic targets for human CP.",

Wg is expressed at the posterior border of mature parasegments, toll10 in even-numbered immature parasegments and at the anterior border of all mature parasegments, and sim is expressed in cells of the ventral midline and can be used to demarcate ectoderm and mesoderm.

After fixation, samples were stored in 70% ethanol until paraffin embedding. 4-\u00b5m sections were cut. The slides were stained on the Leica Bond RX autostainer according to standard protocols provided by Leica and Akoya Biosciences.  Briefly, the slides were deparaffinized, heat treated in antigen retrieval buffer, blocked, and incubated with primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody polymer (Akoya), and HRP-reactive OPAL fluorescent reagents (Akoya) that use TSA chemistry to deposit dyes on the tissue immediately surrounding each HRP molecule. To prevent further deposition of fluorescent dyes in subsequent staining steps, the slides were stripped in between each stain with heat treatment in antigen retrieval buffer (Akoya). We performed 7 color multispectral imaging using the Akoya Biosciences Vectra Polaris instrument. Six markers were utilized, including insulin (\u03b2-cells) (OPAL: 480), glucagon (\u03b1-cells) (OPAL: 620), CD11c (for myeloid cells) (OPAL: 520), CD3 (for T cells) (OPAL: 570), and F4/80 (for macrophages) (OPAL: 780).

Protocols for their care and use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of JHU, USUHS, and UAM. All research was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Agriculture (JHU and USUHS) and European Union (UAM) guidelines. Studies involving deidentified donor testes tissues have been reviewed and designated by Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and USUHS IRBs as \u201cnot human subjects research\u201d (IRB No: 00006700 and DBS.2024.685) and approved for use by The USU Human Anatomical Materials Review Committee (HAMRC; #71-22-034). \n\nMice\nMice harboring the Sas4 cKO allele (C57BL/6N; Cenpjtm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi) and mice harboring a Plk1 cKO allele (C57BL/6N; Plk1tm1c(EUCOMM)Hmgu) were previously described (Bazzi & Anderson, 2014; Phan et al, 2021; Little & Jordan, 2020; Wellard et al, 2021). Within the Sas4 allele are two loxP sites flanking the 5th exon of Sas4 (McIntyre et al, 2012). Within the Plk1 allele are two loxP sites flanking the 3rd exon of Plk1. The Plk4 cKO allele (B6;SJL-Plk4em1Ahol/J) contains two loxP sites that flank the 5th exon of Plk4 (LoMastro et al, 2022). Mice harboring the Plk4-mCherry OE allele were obtained from the Institute Curie, Paris. The Plk4-mCherry OE allele contains a floxed stop cassette upstream of the Plk4-mCherry sequence, preventing Plk4-mCherry expression prior to excision by Cre recombinase (Marthiens et al, 2013). Mice harboring the Centrin-GFP transgene (CB6-Tg(CAG-EGFP/CETN2)3-4Jgg/J) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Higginbotham et al, 2004). Conditional mutation was achieved by crossing in a hemizygous Cre recombinase transgene that is under the control of a meiosis-specific promoter. The Spo11 (Tg(Spo11-cre)1Rsw), Stra8 (Tg(Stra8-iCre)1Reb/LguJ), and Hspa2 (Tg(Hspa2-cre)1Eddy/J) promoters were used to drive Cre recombinase expression in this study (Lyndaker et al, 2013; Inselman et al, 2010; Sadate\u2011Ngatchou et al, 2008).\n\nOocyte harvesting and culture\nOocytes were collected as previously reported (Hwang et al, 2018b). Female mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG; Sigma) to prime ovarian follicles. After 44-48 hours germinal vesicle-staged oocytes were harvested from the ovaries into M2 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life technologies), 3 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 10 mM milrinone (Sigma). Oocyte cumulus complexes were treated for 1-2 minutes in 300 IU/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma) in M2 medium supplemented with 3 mg/mL BSA to denude oocytes of the surrounding cumulus cells. Oocytes were then washed and cultured for 24 hours in M2 media supplemented with 5% FBS and 3% BSA at 37\u00b0C. Oocytes were visually assessed for progression to metaphase I and metaphase II. Metaphase II oocytes were collected for genotyping by intraperitoneally injecting female mice with 5IU of PMSG, followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG; Sigma) 48 hours later. Oocytes were collected from the ampulla, and approximately 20 denuded oocytes were lysed in 10 \u03bcL of PBND buffer that was heated for 30 min at 56oC, 10 min at 95oC, then brought to room temperature (Scavizzi et al, 2015).\n\nPCR genotyping\nPCR genotyping was performed using AccuStart II PCR SuperMix (Quanta BioSciences). Primers used during this study are described in Appendix Table S1. PCR conditions: 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 34-38 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s; 58\u00b0C for 30 s; and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, then a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min.\n\nHuman testes \nDeidentified decedent adult human donor testes (HT10, age 24) were obtained through the Washington Regional Transplant Consortium (WRTC, Annandale, VA, USA), which are now known as Infinite Legacy (Halethorpe, MD, USA). \n\nTubule squash preparations\nMouse tubule squash preparations were performed as previously described (Wellard et al, 2018). Primary and secondary antibodies and dilutions used are presented in Appendix Table S2. Tubule squash preparations were mounted in Vectashield + DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) medium (Vector Laboratories). Full Z-stack captured images were utilized to manually identify centrioles, centrosomes, spindle morphology, and chromosome structure.\n\nChromatin spread preparations\nMouse chromatin spread preparations were performed as previously described (Wellard et al, 2020). Primary and secondary antibodies and dilutions used are presented in Appendix Table S2. Chromatin spread preparations were immunolabeled and mounted in Vectashield + DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Full Z-stack captured images were utilized to manually identify chromosome structure.\n\nInhibitor treatment of seminiferous tubules\nSeminiferous tubules were prepared for inhibitor treatment as previously reported (Simerly et al, 2024). Testes from 24-27 dpp mice were removed into KRB enriched with 10 mM HEPES (eKRB). Tubules were transferred into 50 mL falcon tubes and allowed to settle for 5 min in eKRB at 34 \u00b0C. The supernatant was then decanted, and tubules were resuspended in 10 mL of 1 mg/ml collagenase IV in eKRB and agitated for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C. Following agitation, tubules were allowed to settle by gravity sedimentation and washed twice in eKRB. After the second wash, they were resuspended in eKRB containing either 10 \u00b5M of MLN8237 (AURKA inhibitor; Cayman Chemicals), 10 \u00b5M of ARRY-520 (KIF11 inhibitor, Cayman Chemicals), or 10 \u00b5M of DYNARRESTIN (Dynein inhibitor, Cayman Chemicals) and incubated at 34 \u00b0C for 1-2 hours. Following incubation, tubules underwent tubule squash preparation as described above.\n\nCulture of seminiferous tubules and centrinone-B treatment\nCulture of seminiferous tubules was performed as previously described (Alfaro et al, 2021; Sato et al, 2011). Testes from adult C57BL/6 (wild-type, WT) mice were removed, detunicated and fragments of seminiferous tubules were cultured at 34 \u00b0C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 onto agarose gel half-soaked in MEM\u03b1 culture medium (Gibco A10490-01) supplemented with KnockOut Serum Replacement (KOSR) (Gibco 10828-010), antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin; Biochrom AG, A2213), and 1-100 \u00b5m of centrinone-B (Tocris, LCR-323). Controls were kept in MEM\u03b1 culture medium without Centrinone-B. After 8 and 24 h, control and inhibitor-treated seminiferous tubules were subjected to the squashing technique described above. \n\nHistology and cryo-sectioning\nFor histological assessment, mouse testis tissue was fixed in bouins fixative (Ricca Chemical Company) prior to paraffin embedding. Serial sections, 5 \u00b5m thick, were mounted onto slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cryo-sectioning testis tissue was embedded in O.C.T. compound (Fisher) and frozen at -80\u00b0C. Serial sections, 16 \u00b5m thick, were cut using Cryo3 (Sakura Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA, USA) and mounted onto Selectfrost Adhesion microscope slides (Fisher). Slides were then fixed with 2.5% formalin in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed in PBS. Slides were then immunolabeled as previously described (Atkins et al, 2020) with primary and secondary antibodies (see Appendix Table S2). \n\nEpididymal sperm count\nMouse epididymides (one per mouse) were dissected and placed into PBS, then cut into several smaller pieces and incubated for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C to allow time for sperm to be released from the tissue. The sperm-containing solution was then transferred to a fresh tube, separating released sperm from epididymal tissue, and diluted as necessary before counting sperm with a hemocytometer. \n\nMicroscope image acquisition\nTubule squash and chromatin spread images were captured using a Zeiss CellObserver Z1 linked to an ORCA-Flash 4.0 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu). Histology and cryo-sectioning images were captured using a Keyence BZ-800 and BZ-X800 Viewer and Analyzer software. Images were processed using ZEN 2012 blue edition imaging software (Zeiss) or BZ-X800 Viewer and Analyzer software (Keyence). Images were analyzed using the Zeiss ZEN 2012 blue edition image software, and Photoshop (Adobe) was used to prepare the figure images.\n\nMicrotubule length and width measurements\nSpindle measurements were made using ZEN 2012 blue edition imaging software (Zeiss). The spindle length was obtained by measuring from where microtubule nucleation began at an MTOC to the aligned chromosomes on the metaphase I spindle. The width of the spindle was measured proximal to aligned chromosomes on the metaphase I spindle. The width and length of both spindles of a metaphase I spermatocyte were measured and reported as a ratio of A:B, with A being the smaller of the two length or width measurements (Fig 6B and D).\n\nData and statistical analysis\nAll graphics and statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. Each figure legend provides details of cell and animal counts and statistical analyses.\n\nData Availability \nRequest for data should be addressed to Philip Jordan (philip.jordan@usuhs.edu)\n",

    "title": "Inverse blebs operate as hydraulic pumps during mouse blastocyst formation",
    "release_date": "2024-06-14",
    "description": "During preimplantation development, mouse embryos form a fluid-filled lumen, which sets their first axis of symmetry1,2. Pressurized fluid breaks open cell-cell contacts and accumulates into pockets, which gradually coarsen into a single lumen3\u20135. During coarsening, cellular adhesive and contractile properties are thought to guide intercellular fluid (IF) but what cell behavior may control fluid movements is unknown. Here, we report large fluid-filled spherical membrane intrusions called inverse blebs6,7 growing into cells at adhesive contacts. At the onset of lumen coarsening, we observed hundreds of inverse blebs throughout the embryo, each dynamically filling with IF and retracting within a minute. We find that inverse blebs grow due to pressure build-up resulting from luminal fluid accumulation and cell-cell adhesion, which locally confines fluid. Inverse blebs then retract due to actomyosin contraction, which effectively redistributes fluid within the intercellular space. Importantly, inverse blebs show topological specificity and mostly occur at contacts between two cells, rarely at contacts formed by multiple cells, which essentially serve as fluid sinks. Manipulating the topology of the embryo reveals that, in the absence of sinks, inverse blebs pump fluid into one another in a futile cycle. We propose that inverse blebs operate as hydraulic pumps to promote luminal coarsening, thereby constituting an instrument used by cells to control fluid movement.",

Data are plotted using Graphpad Prism 9.5.1.\n\nInverse bleb count\nThe inverse bleb number in confocal and light-sheet time lapses is manually counted. A bleb is defined as a transient hemispherical actin-positive intrusion appearing at cell-cell contacts. \nWhen embryos are imaged every minute continuously throughout lumen formation, the number of blebs is provided as such. When embryos are sampled every 5 or 10 s, the number of blebs is provided per min.\nInverse blebs are allocated to TE or ICM cells based on the position of the cells: TE cells contact the surface of the embryo while ICM cells are surrounded by other cells.\nInverse blebs are allocated into a distal and proximal half by determining the site of blastocoel formation in the equatorial plane and bisecting the embryo in two equal halves.\nInverse blebs are allocated to: (1) a bicellular interface when they do not touch a multicellular interface and are oriented away from the bicellular interface; (2) a multicellular interface when they touch that interface and are oriented away from the multicellular interface; (3) an unclear category when they touch a multicellular interface and are oriented away from a neighboring bicellular interface,\n\nDuration of the microlumen phase\nMicrolumen duration of embryos, quartets and doublets is determined as the time between the appearance of the first and disappearance of the last microlumens as detected visually.\n\nDynamics of individual inverse blebs\nInverse bleb dynamics are measured using FIJI by tracing the outline of inverse blebs using a line width of 1 \u00b5m. Before and after inverse bleb formation and retraction, a line corresponding to the opening width of the inverse bleb is measured. For each inverse bleb, measurements are taken 82.5 s before and after reaching their maximum size (90 s after size maximum for para-Nitroblebbistatin treatment).\nThe time of maximal size of each inverse bleb is taken as a reference time point. Intensity values of LifeAct-GFP, MYH9-GFP, CDH1-GFP and mTmG are first normalized to 82.5 s before inverse bleb size maximum and then to their minimal and maximal values. The lifetime of an inverse bleb is taken as the time during which a visible membrane protrusion is seen extending at a cell-cell contact until the time it is no longer visible. The retraction time is taken as the time of inverse bleb duration from its maximal size to its disappearance.\nUsing R segmented package54, the LifeAct-GFP and MYH9-GFP recruitment times are calculated using iterative linear regression on the intensity data taken until the maximum value to find the breakpoint between the stable intensity and intensity increase.\n\nBlastocoel volume\nBlastocoel volume is measured on full-volume light sheet z-stacks using the FIJI plugin LimeSeg55. The blastocoel is traced back from the expanded blastocyst and measured as soon as a lumen is present (smallest segmented lumen < 1 pL). Before that, blastocoel volume is assumed to be 0 pL.\n\nStatistics\nStatistical test were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10\u22122. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments.\n"

A 60 \u00b5m z-stack with a 5 \u00b5m step size is acquired before every time lapse to discern TE and ICM cells.\nTo measure microlumen duration in WT, mCdh1+/- or mMyh9+/-  embryos, embryos expressing mTmG are imaged every 5 min for from E2.5 to E3.5, capturing a z-stack of 28 \u00b5m of the upper half of each embryo with a 4 \u00b5m step size.\nIn order to simultaneously track inverse bleb number and/or microlumens, WT or mCdh1+/- embryos, WT/WT and mMyh9+/-/WT chimeras, doublets and quartets are imaged at the equatorial plane every 1 min from before microlumen initiation until lumen formation is completed.\n",

The animal facilities are operated according to international animal welfare rules.\nEmbryos are isolated from superovulated female mice mated with male mice. Superovulation of female mice is induced by intraperitoneal injection of 5 international units (IU) pregnant mare\u2019s serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Ceva, Syncro-part), followed by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, MSD Animal Health, Chorulon) 44-48 hours later. Embryos are recovered at E1.5 or E2.5 by flushing oviducts or/and uteri from plugged females with 37\u00b0C FHM (LifeGlobal, ZEHP-050 or Millipore, MR-122-D) using a modified syringe (Acufirm, 1400 LL 23).\nEmbryos are handled using an aspirator tube (Sigma, A5177-5EA) equipped with a glass pipette pulled from glass micropipettes (Blaubrand intraMark or Warner Instruments).\nEmbryos are placed in KSOM (LifeGlobal, ZEKS-050 or Millipore, MR-107-D) supplemented with 0.1% BSA (Sigma, A3311) in 10 \u03bcL droplets covered in mineral oil (Sigma, M8410 or Acros Organics). Embryos are cultured in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2  at 37\u00b0C.\nTo remove the zona zellucida (ZP), embryos are incubated for 45-60 s in pronase (Sigma, P8811).\nTo dissociate blastomeres, embryos without ZP are incubated in EDTA containing Ca2+ free KSOM46 at the 8- or 16-cell stage for 3-5 minutes, followed by repeated aspiration into a smoothened glass capillary leading to dissociation of the embryo. Blastomeres were subsequently washed and cultured in KSOM as described above. 8-cell stage embryos were dissociated into single blastomeres. 16-cell stage embryos were dissociated into single 16-cell blastomeres or 16-cell blastomere doublets, which results, after development in KSOM, in the formation of 32-cell stage doublets or quartets, respectively.\nTo create chimeric embryos, blastomeres were dissociated at the 8-cell stage and grafted on a morula without ZP.\nFor imaging, embryos are placed in 5 mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek).\n",

            "protocol_description": "Mice were killed following deep anesthesia with a mix of ketamine/xylazine, followed by intracardiac perfusion with heparinized PBS (10\u2009U/ml heparin) and by a perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Tissues and organs were dissected, weighed and post-fixed at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Immunostaining for c-Fos was performed using a modified version of SHANEL (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420301112). All incubation steps were carried out under moderate shaking (300\u2009rpm). For the pretreatment, samples were dehydrated with an ethanol/water series (50%, 70% and 100% ethanol) at room temperature for 3\u2009h per step. Next, samples were incubated in dichloromethane (DCM) /methanol (2:1\u2009v/v) at room temperature for 1 day. Brains were rehydrated with an ethanol/water series (100%, 70% and 50% ethanol and diH2O) at room temperature for 3\u2009h per step. Samples were incubated in 0.5\u2009M acetic acid at room temperature for 5\u2009h followed by washing with diH2O. Next, brains were incubated in 4\u2009M guanidine HCl, 0.05\u2009M sodium acetate, 2% v/v Triton X-100, pH 6.0, at room temperature for 5\u2009h followed by washing with diH2O. Brains were incubated in a mix of 10% CHAPS and 25% N-methyldiethanolamine at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 12\u2009h before washing with diH2O. Blocking was performed by incubating the brains in 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 10% goat serum in PBS shaking at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2 days. Samples were incubated with c-Fos primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 2250, 1:1000 dilution) in primary antibody buffer (0.2% Tween-20, 5% dimethylsulfoxide, 3% goat serum and 100\u2009\u00b5l heparin per 100\u2009ml PBS) shaking at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 7 days. The antibody solution was filtered (22-\u00b5m pore size) before use. Samples were washed in washing solution (0.2% Tween-20 and 100\u2009\u00b5l heparin in 100\u2009ml PBS) shaking at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1 day at which the washing solution was refreshed five times. Brains were incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 647 and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) from Invitrogen, A-21245, 1:500 dilution) in secondary antibody buffer (0.2% Tween-20, 3% goat serum and 100\u2009\u00b5l heparin per 100\u2009ml PBS) shaking at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 7 days followed by incubating in washing solution shaking at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1 day at which the washing solution was refreshed five times. Brains were dehydrated using 3DISCO with a THF/H2O series (50%, 70%, 90% and 100% THF) for 12\u2009h per step followed by an incubation in DCM for 1\u2009h. Tissues were incubated in benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate (1:2\u2009v/v) until tissue transparency was reached (>4\u2009h). \nPlease refer to https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02245-2 for more details about the preparation step.",

Twelve hours afer injection of EB dye, we anesthetized the animals with a combination of midazolam, medetomidine and fentanyl (administered intraperitoneally; 1ml per 100 g body weight containing 5mg, 0.5mg and 0.05mg per kg body weight, respectively) and opened their chest for transcardial perfusion. Medium with WGA (0.25mg WGA conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 dye (Termo Fisher Scientifc, W11262) in 150\u00b5l PBS, pH7.2) was supplied by peristaltic pump set to deliver the medium at a rate of 8ml/min, along with 15ml of 1\u00d7 PBS and 15ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. This short perfusion protocol was established on the basis of preliminary experiments, where both WGA and EB staining were partially washed out, with the goal of delivering fixative to brain tissue via the vessels to achieve a homogenous preservation efect. \nAfter perfusion, brains were extracted from the neurocranium while severing some of the segments of the circle of Willis, which is an inevitable component of most retrieval processes aside from corrosion cast techniques. Next, the samples were incubated in 3DISCO clearing solutions. Briefly, we immersed them in a gradient of tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich, 186562): 50%, 70%, 80% and 90% (in distilled water) followed by 100%, at 25 \u00b0C for 12h at each concentration. At this point, we modified the protocol by incubating the samples in tert-butanol for 12h at 35 \u00b0C followed by immersion in dichloromethane (Sigma-Aldrich, 270997) for 12h at room temperature and a final incubation with refractive index-matched BABB solution (benzyl alcohol+benzyl benzoate, 1:2; Sigma-Aldrich, 24122 and W213802), for at least 24h at room temperature until transparency was achieved. Each incubation step was carried out on a laboratory shaker. \nPlease refer to https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0792-1 for more details about the preparation step.",

            "protocol_description": "The brains of human males were fixed in situ by whole head perfusion via carotid and vertebral arteries under a pressure of below 1 bar. The head was first perfused with 5 L heparinized 0.01 M PBS (10 U/ml of heparin, Ratiopharm), followed by 3 L 4% PFA in 0.01 M PBS for 2-3 h. The veins were finally closed to maintain the PFA to the brain. Then the brains were recovered by calvarian dissection and preserved at least 1-2 weeks for post-fixation submersed in the 4% PFA solution. \nPFA-fixed intact human brain was actively pumped with 5 L 10% w/v CHAPS and 25% w/v N- Methyldiethanolamine solution for one month with solution refreshed once at day 15. Then the solution was changed to PBS for active washing for 2 days. The intact human brain was cooled in PBS at 4 \u00b0C overnight, then directly cut into 1.5 cm-thick slices in coronal plane using a Rotation Cutting Slicer (Rotation Schneidemaschine, Biodur, Heidelberg, Germany). The total 12 slices were serially labeled and stored in 70% EtOH at 4 \u00b0C. \nA 1.5 cm-thick intact human brain slice was randomly chosen and passively incubated with 400 mL TO-PRO-3 (1:2000 dilution) in PBS at room temperature for 1 week. Then the solution was changed to 400 mL with 100 mM of Methoxy X-04 (Tocris, 4920) in 40% EtOH (pH = 10 adjusted by NaOH (Roth, 6771.1)) and the sample was incubated for another week. After labeling, the slice was washed with PBS for 1 day. The clearing started with dehydration using a series of 1 L of EtOH/DiH2O solutions (50%, 70%, 100%, 100% v/v) and followed by delipidation using 1 L DCM. Each step lasted 1 day. Then the samples were incubated in 1 L BABB solution at room temperature until completely transparency in around 2 weeks.\n1.5 cm-thick human brain slices were randomly chosen and dehydrated with a series of 1 L EtOH/DiH2O (50%, 70%, 100%, 100% v/v), then delipidated with 2 L DCM/MeOH (2:1 v/v), then rehydrated with a series of 1 L EtOH/DiH2O (100%, 70%, 50%, 0% v/v) at room temperature. After incubating with 1 L 0.5 M acetic acid (Roth, T179.1) in DiH2O, this solution was changed to a mixture of 4 M guanidine hydrochloride (Roth, 6069.3), 0.05 M sodium acetate (Sigma, S2889) and 2% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH = 6.0, at room temperature to loosen the extra cellular matrix. The incubation time for each of all above mentioned solutions was 1 day. Next, the slices were shortly incubated with 10% w/v CHAPS and 25% w/v N-Methyldiethanolamine solution for 4 hours and washed with PBS for 1 day. The intact slices were stored in the blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100/10% DMSO (Roth, A994.2)/10% goat serum/PBS) at 4 \u00b0C.\nRegions of interest (including hippocampus, primary motor cortex, primary sensory cortex, and primary visual cortex, 2-4 cm x 2-4 cm x 1.5 cm) were cut and incubated with the same blocking buffer at 37 \u00b0C for 1 day. Then the samples were incubated with rabbit antibody anti-Iba1 (1:1000, Wako, 019-19741) or rabbit antibody anti-TH (1:250, abcam, ab112) in the antibody incubation buffer (3% goat serum/3% DMSO/0.2% Tween-20/10mg\u2219L-1Heparin/PBS) for 1 week at 37 \u00b0C. After the primary antibody incubation, samples were washed with the washing buffer (0.2% Tween-20/10mg\u2219L-1Heparin/PBS) for 1 day refreshing 3 times and then incubated with Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Thermo Fisher, A-21245) in the antibody incubation buffer for 1 week at 37 \u00b0C. Other samples were incubated with DyLight 649-lectin (1:500, Vector, DL-1178) in the antibody incubation buffer for 1 week at 37 \u00b0C. After washing with PBS, propidium iodide (1:100, Thermo Fisher, P3566) or TO-PRO-3 dye was added in PBS for 3 days at 37 for cell nuclei staining. After labeling, the samples were dehydrated with a series of solutions of EtOH/DiH2O (50%, 70%, 100%, 100% v/v) and delipidated with the DCM solution for 4 hours each solution followed by BABB incubation at room temperature until the sample transparency was reached in 2-3 days.\nPlease refer to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420301112 for more details about the preparation step.",

Zebrafish mutant for gad1a or gad1b were generated as previously described (VanLeuven et al., 2018; O'Connor et al., 2019). All adult fish were maintained in an Aquatic Habitats (Apopka, FL) multi-rack system. Habitat water consisted of reverse osmosis filtered/sterilized water to which sodium bicarbonate and other salts (Instant Ocean, Aquarium Systems, Inc., Mentor, OH, USA) were added to maintain pH from 7.0-7.4 and conductivity between 400 and 430 \u00b5S. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for use of zebrafish in research under protocols approved and overseen by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee."

            "protocol_description": "Plasmid construct design for GFP-receiver cells\nThe chimeric protein anti-GFP synNotch receptor (Addgene, #162230) was constructed by fusing the following three proteins: anti-GFP nanobody LaG17 (41) in the extracellular domain, mouse Notch1 (NM_008714) in the minimal regulatory region (Ile1427 to Arg 1752) in the transmembrane region, and TetR-VP64 in the intracellular domain (31). To enable transmembrane protein expression, a CD8\u03b1 signal sequence (MALPVTALLLPLALLLHAARP) was inserted at the N-terminus of synNotch receptor. Additionally, a Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was fused to the N-terminus of LaG17 facilitate its detection in cell surface through immunostaining. The GFP-anchor protein (Addgene, #162225) consists of a CD8a signal sequence, an HA tag, an anti-GFP nanobody (LaG2), and a PDGFR transmembrane domain. These were then cloned into a modified pHR\u2019SIN:CSW vector under the EF1\u03b1 promoter. Human E-cadherin (NM_004360) was cloned under the control of the EF1\u03b1 promoter to generate imCEcad cells.\nFor inducible expression in response to synNotch stimuli, the following target genes were cloned under tetracycline-responsive element (TRE; TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGA), fused to a minimal CMV promoter. TRE-->mCherry_PGK-->tagBFP (Addgene, #162231): The TRE promoter drives mCherry reporter expression, while the PGK promoter drives tagBFP as an integration marker. TRE-->E-cadherin-mCherry_PGK-->tagBFP: The TRE promoter drives the fusion of E-cadherin and mCherry, with the PGK promoter driving tagBFP as an integration marker. The C terminus of human E-cadherin was directly fused to the N terminus of mCherry.\n\nPlasmid construct design for GFP-secretor cells\nMembrane-tethered GFP (Addgene, #79130) comprised an Ig kappa chain V-III region signal sequence (METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGD), EGFP, and a PDGFR transmembrane domain. To enable protein secretion, secretory GFP was constructed by fusing the Gaussia luciferase signal sequence (MGVKVLFALICIAVAEA) to the N-terminus of EGFP. NLS (Nucleus Localizing Signal)-fused Infrared Fluorescence Protein (IFP2.0) connected to mouse P-cadherin via P2A ribosomal skipping sequence was cloned into the modified pHR\u2019SIN:CSW vector under an EF1\u03b1 promoter, allowing visualization of the GFP-secretor spheroid and preventing mixing with GFP-secretor cells and GFP-receiver cells in the spheroid culture.\n\nPlasmid construct design for other cadherin-expressing cells\nFor the Figure 5A and 5B, NLS-fused IFP2.0 was connected to E-cadherin via the P2A ribosomal skipping sequence. To visualize the P-cadherin core spheroids in the Figure 5B, we fused P-cadherin to mCherry via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Cadherins were cloned under the control of the EF1\u03b1 promoter in the modified pHRSIN:CSW vector.\n\nCell culture\nAll cells were cultured in DMEM (Nacalai tesque, #08458-16) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin solution (Wako, #168-23191) at 37 \u00baC in humidified environment with 5% CO2. The mouse fibroblast cell line L929 (RIKEN BRC, Cell Bank) was cultured on 60 mm TC-treated culture dishes (Greiner, #628160). The human erythroleukemic cell line K562 (ATCC, #CCL-243) was cultured in 60 mm non-treated culture dishes (Corning, #430589). \n\nLentiviral transduction of L929 cell\nAll cells used in this study were stably transformed using lentiviral transduction. The cell lines were established as follows: 1) A lentivirus was generated by transfecting the pHR\u2019SIN:CSW vector and the viral packaging plasmids pCMVdR8.91 and pMD2.G into HEK293T cells using PEI MAX (Polysciences, #24765). 2) 1.0x105 L929 cells were cultured with variable amounts of lentiviral supernatant and 10 \u03bcg/mL hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, #H9268) in 12-well plates (Corning, #3513) for 48 h. \n\nConstruction of synNotch-expressing cells (imC and iEcad-mC cells)\nFollowing lentiviral infection with the anti-GFP synNotch expression plasmid and the inducible target gene plasmid, the cells were split into two wells in a 12-well plate and cultured overnight. Then 8.0x105 K562 cells expressing the membrane-tethered GFP ligand (K562mGFP) were added to each well (18). After synNotch stimulation by K562mGFP cells for 24 h, we analyzed the basal/induced expression levels of reporter fluorescent proteins and sorted the target cells into 96-well plates (Corning, #3595) at a single cell per well using a cell sorter (SH800S, SONY). When the sorted cells reached confluence in each well of the 96-well plates, they were split into three 96-well plates. After two days of culture, 4.0x104 K562mGFP were added to each well of one of the 96 plates. Another plate was used as the control without stimuli, and the other plate was used to pick up the clones. After screening the clones using a cell analyzer (SA3800, SONY), we selected several clones whose basal expression of the target gene was low, but induction was high. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using the FlowJo software.\n\nPattern formation assay in SYMPLE3D\nOrganizer and receiver spheroids were prepared following these procedures:\n1) GFP-secretor cells were plated at 50 cells/well in a 96-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plate (Corning, #7007) with 200 \u00b5L of medium. GFP-receiver cells were plated at 200 cells/well in 384-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plate (Corning, #3830) with 50 \u00b5L of medium. The plates were then centrifuged at 100 x g for 2 min and incubated overnight. \n2) After spheroid formation, 160 \u00b5L of supernatant medium was removed from each well of the 96-well plate of secretor cells. \n3) 30 \u00b5L of medium containing a secretor spheroid, was transferred to each well of the 384-well receiver plate using tip-cut 200 \u00b5L pipette tip.\n4) Time-lapse imaging was started immediately, or snapshots were acquired after 48 h of incubation using a confocal microscope. Secretor cells were plated at varying densities of 25, 50, 100, and 200 cells/well to form secretor spheroids of variable sizes.\n\nPattern formation in 2D culture system\nA two-well culture-insert (ibidi, #80209) was placed in the center of each well in a 24-well plate. 1.6x104 GFP-secretor cells with 80 \u00b5L of medium were plated in the left side of the insert,  while 8x103 GFP-receiver cells with 80 \u00b5L were plated in the right side, and the outside of the insert are filled with 3x104 LaG2-anchor expressing cells as a sink. The plate was then centrifuged at 100 x g for 2 min and incubated overnight. The left side of the insert (region of secretor cells) was gently washed with 80 \u00b5L of medium twice. After removing the insert and aspirating the supernatant, 800 \u00b5L of medium containing 1% agarose (NIPPON GENE, 317-01182) was slowly added to each well. This medium was prepared by mixing DMEM containing 20% FBS with PBS (Wako, 049-29793) containing 2% agarose at a 1:1 ratio. The images were acquired under confocal microscopy after leaving the plate at room temperature for 15 min until gelation.\n\nGFP titration assay\nGFP receiver cells or parental L929 cells were plated at 100 cells/well in 40 \u00b5L of medium in a 384-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plate. The plate was then centrifuged at 100 x g for 2 min and incubated for 24 h. Following the formation of spheroids, 40 \u00b5L of DMEM containing 10% FBS and various concentrations of purified GFP were added to each well. Spheroids were incubated for 48 h, followed by image acquisition.\n\nE-cadherin mixing assay\nE-cadherin-high cells (L929 cells expressing E-cadherin under a EF1a promoter) were plated at 100 cells/well in 96-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plate with 200 \u00b5L of medium. Equal number of L929 and imC or iEcad-mC cells (30 cells) were mixed in 30 \u00b5L medium and plated in a 384-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plate. The plate was then centrifuged at 100 x g for 2 min and incubated for 24 h to form spheroids. We then transferred 30 \u00b5L of the medium containing E-cadherin high spheroid into a 384-well plate and added 30 \u00b5L of medium containing various concentrations of purified GFP. Time-lapse imaging started immediately after adding GFP or the spheroids were incubated for 48 h followed by image acquisition. \n\nCell movement assay\nTo track cell movement inside E-cadherin-expressing spheroids, 199 E-cadherin-expressing cells and a single cell labeled with IFP (E-cadherin- and NLS-IFP2.0-expressing cells) were plated in 384-well round-bottom ultralow-attachment plates. To compensate for spheroid movement and rotation during culture, a P-cadherin-expressing spheroid was placed next to an E-cadherin-expressing spheroid. The reference spheroid was formed by plating cells expressing P-cadherin and mCherry at a density of 50 cells/well in a 96-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plate with 200 \u00b5L of medium. The plates were then centrifuged at 100 x g for 2 min and incubated overnight. After spheroid formation, 160 \u00b5L of supernatant medium was removed from each well, and 30 \u00b5L of medium containing the reference spheroid was transferred to each well of the 384-well plate containing E-cadherin-expressing cells using tip-cut 200 \u00b5L pipette tips. Time-lapse imaging was initiated immediately.",

For the leaf length, a line was drawn centrally from the leaf base to the leaf tip. The leaf width is a line orthogonal to the leaf length at the height of the first half of the leaf. For the leaf area, the images of the entire leaf were segmented in the Labkit plugin. The resulting classifier and the mask were saved separately. The segmented image was then opened in ImageJ/Fiji and edited if necessary. Editing involved removing excess objects that interfered with the measurement or extended leaf veins that were pulled out of the stem, for example in the segmentations of the species Bryum sp. Finally, the segmentations were saved and measured using the \u201cMagic Wand\u201d tool and the measurement method included in ImageJ/Fiji. The scale of the original image was previously set to \u201cGlobal\u201d in the settings so that the segmentation corresponds to the same scale. Overlapping leaf areas or obviously missing areas, e.g. broken leaf parts, were then marked and measured in the original image using a polygon selection. The resulting values were then added together in the final data table. The cell images were measured without additional segmentation. From each of the three images, a random cell was measured from the center of the image. Only lamina cells were measured. For the length, the distance between the two farthest ends of a cell was used, while the width was recorded as a line orthogonal to it. The width and height were recorded in the images of the cross sections. Width is determined by a line centered between the two farthest ends of the cross-section, while height is determined by measuring individual cells along a line orthogonal to the width of the cross-section. For plants that have a midrib in their leaves, the width and height of the midrib could also be measured. The width was measured using a central line between the two furthest points of the midrib. The height was determined using a central line orthogonal to the width of the midrib. For the species Grimmia pulvinata, the length of the glass hair was also measured. For this purpose, a line was drawn from the base of the glass hair to the tip and measured.\n\n(*translated with DeepL)"

            "protocol_description": "Methodology and procedure of the weight measurements\nTo measure the weight, part of the collected sample was transferred to a Petri dish and rehydrated using ultrapure water. The ultrapure water used has a resistance of 18.2 \u03a9 and was freshly filled before each experiment. Six representative plants of one species were removed and superficial dirt was removed. The plants were then placed on filter paper to absorb excess water. All plants were then photographed to measure vegetative plant height. The captured images were later measured using ImageJ/Fiji. The six plants were divided into two groups. Three plants were used to measure the whole plant and the remaining three plants were used to measure the plant without leaves. First, all plants were measured in their rehydrated state using a precision balance. Then the leaves of the second group were completely removed using tweezers. To simplify this process, two pairs of tweezers should be used. The first grips the plant at the top end, while the second moves carefully down the stem to allow the tightly fitting leaves to protrude from the stem and, ideally, remove them at the same time. The leaves hanging from the tweezers can be collected in a Petri dish with a small pond of water. The plants removed from the leaves were measured again on the precision balance. Finally, three more measurements were taken from representative leaves. Again, the process can be facilitated by transferring the previously collected leaves to a filter paper to collect the required number of leaves. Once the filter paper is no longer wet, the leaves can simply be transferred to a weighing dish, either by transferring individual leaves or by sliding the leaves off the filter paper with tweezers. All samples are then dried in an incubator for 60 min at 40 \u00b0C and then measured again on the precision balance. To ensure the completeness of the samples during drying, the samples were sealed with tape in a box made from weighing dishes. The box was provided with small holes for ventilation. The resulting data are the fresh weight and dry weight of the plant with leaves, the fresh weight and dry weight of the plant without leaves and the fresh weight and dry weight of the leaves. \n\nMethodology and procedure for recording leaf characteristics\nThree plants of each species were used to record data on leaf characteristics. The plants were previously rehydrated in pure water and cleaned of dirt. From these three plants, a total of three representative leaves were taken from the center of the main stem and transferred to microscope slides with pure water. For each leaf, one image of the whole leaf and three images at cell level were taken. Each image was saved in .tif and .nd2 image formats. In addition, a cross-section was made for each species.\n\n(*translated with DeepL)",

    "description": "In order to test the combination of a microscope and mobile phone to take bioImages, samples of plants such as leaves, petals and seeds were collected from around the Wellcome Genome Campus in Hinxton.  Each sample was dissected into small pieces and mounted on glass slides then placed under the lens whilst a attachment that held the phone over the eyepice of the microscope was fixed in place. As the phone would automatically focus the image, it was difficult to gauge how much more focus the sample required because the auto-focus would change everytime the microscope stage was moved to focus. As a result, the auto-focus was switched off before the images were taken. The phone magnification was kept at 1x so not to affect the images and each change in magnification of the microscope was recorded. ",

Each sample was dissected into small pieces and mounted on glass slides then placed under the lens whilst a attachment that held the phone over the eyepice of the microscope was fixed in place. As the phone would automatically focus the image, it was difficult to gauge how much more focus the sample required because the auto-focus would change everytime the microscope stage was moved to focus. As a result, the auto-focus was switched off before the images were taken. The phone magnification was kept at 1x so not to affect the images and each change in magnification of the microscope was recorded. ",

    "title": "A noncanonical repressor function of JUN restrains YAP activity and suppresses YAP-dependent liver cancer growth",
    "release_date": "2024-07-02",
    "description": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homologue, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), are the main transcriptional downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Decreased Hippo pathway activity leads to nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ where they interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce target gene expression. Unrestrained YAP/TAZ activity can lead to excessive growth and tumor formation in a short time, underscoring the evolutionary need for tight control of these two transcriptional coactivators. \nHere, we report that the AP-1 component JUN acts as specific repressor of YAP/TAZ at joint target sites to decrease YAP/TAZ activity. This function of JUN is independent of its heterodimeric AP-1 partner FOS and the canonical AP-1 function. Since JUN is itself induced by YAP/TAZ, our work identifies a JUN-dependent negative feedback loop that buffers YAP/TAZ activity at joint sites. This negative feedback loop gets disrupted in liver cancer to unlock the full oncogenic potential of YAP/TAZ.\nOur results thus demonstrate an additional layer of control for the important interplay of YAP/TAZ and AP-1. \n",

The \u2018PreciScan\u2019 feature of the Opera Phenix High Content Screening System was used to pre-scan each well with a low magnification objective for objects of interest (spheroids) and then a selected number of these objects were reimaged with a high magnification objective. In general, 49 fields of view (a tile of 7x7 images) were imaged for the pre-scan, which is equivalent to ca. 68 % of the entire well using the 20x objective lens. Typically, 65 planes, each 1 \u00b5m apart, were acquired. This step size was selected as it facilitated a reasonable total imaging time across the plate (see below) and manageable data size for analysis and storage, both of which are considerations for screening approaches. 100 % laser power and exposure times between 120 ms and 500 ms were used.",

During the optimisation phase, several other antibodies were tested at a range of dilutions. Typically 100 \u00b5l solution per well was used.

    "title": "ATUM-Tomo: A multi-scale approach to cellular ultrastructure by combined volume scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography ",
    "release_date": "2024-08-15",
    "description": "Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, Automated Tape Collecting Ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy. However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed \u2018ATUM-Tomo\u2019, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films. ATUM-SEM of serial semi-thick sections and consecutive ET of selected re-mounted sections combines SEM\u2019s fast target recognition and coarse rendering capability with high-resolution volume visualizations, respectively, thus enabling multi-scale interrogation of cellular ultrastructure. As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Microthrombi and associated sites of BBB leakiness were identified by confocal imaging of injected fluorescent and electron-dense nanoparticles, then relocalized by ATUM-SEM, and finally interrogated by correlative ATUM-Tomo. This workflow is a seamless zoom-in on structural BBB pathology from the micro- to the nanometer scale. Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures.",

Hierarchical imaging captures large areas at low resolution that can, in turn, be screened for structures of interest that are subsequently reimaged at higher resolution and so forth. In ATLAS5 Array Tomography (Fibics), wafer overview images were generated (1000 nm/pixel). We acquired whole section low resolution images (0.1\u00d70.1\u00d71 \u00b5m) of every 10th section (thus simulating the thickness of one confocal plane covering 1 \u00b5m thickness) to generate overviews that can be correlated with the confocal imaging data. We used blood vessel patterns, bleedings and the different tissue layers as landmarks. Target regions were identified and acquired at medium resolution (20\u00d720\u00d7200 nm). Within this volume, clots were selected for high-resolution imaging (4-20\u00d74-20\u00d7200 nm). \nFor ATUM-Tomo, electron micrographs were acquired in a similar hierarchical scheme on an Apreo S2 SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the T1 detector. Serial-section acquisition was performed using the Maps2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) software. We acquired images of whole sections at low resolution (100\u00d7100\u00d7400 nm) to facilitate re-location. Anatomical landmarks and vasculature patterns of single SEM overview images and a summed (in Fiji) stack of sections were compared to the confocal data sets in Fiji. Within this volume, we selected a region with clots and transition zones and extravasation for high-resolution imaging at 20\u00d720\u00d7400 nm. We acquired subsets of these regions on each or every second section at 10\u00d710\u00d7400 nm or 10\u00d710\u00d7800 nm resolution, respectively.\n",

The scanned region of approximately 2\u00d72 mm covered the whole cortical thickness of the lesion and peri-lesional area in order to generate overview maps for later correlation. Whole brain images were collected in z-stacks as tile scans with a slice-distance of 5 \u03bcm and a total range of 50 \u03bcm. Specific regions of interest including the microthrombi and sites of extravasation were collected in single plane using 25x magnification (objective: EC Plan-Neofluar 25x/0.8 Imm Korr DIC M27) with an image matrix of 1024\u00d71024 pixel, a pixel scaling of 0.2\u00d70.2 \u03bcm and a depth of 8 bit. After imaging for maximal 1 hour, the glass slide was immersed into a petri dish filled with 1x PBS.

Colloidal gold particles (diameter 20 nm, BBI) serving as fiducials for tomographic reconstruction were then attached to the sections by submerging the grids into a droplet of the pure colloidal gold solution for 1 min. Samples were blotted to remove residual solution and air-dried. Semi-thick sections were imaged using a Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV and equipped with a 4k\u00d74k CMOS camera (OneView, Gatan) as previously described (Kiewisz et al., 2022). Using a dual-axis specimen holder (Type 2040, Fishione, USA), tilt series were recorded from -60\u00b0 to +60\u00b0 with 1\u00b0 increments at a magnification of 4700x and a pixel size of 2.572 nm applying the SerialEM software package (Mastronarde, 2003; Mastronarde, 2005). For dual-tilt electron tomography, the grid was rotated for 90\u00b0 in the XY-plane and the second tilt series was acquired using identical microscope settings (Mastronarde, 1997). Both tomographic image stacks of the same positions were reconstructed, combined and flattened using IMOD (Kremer, Mastronarde and McIntosh, 1996; Mastronarde and Held, 2017). Serial semi-thick sections were stitched and combined by using the ZIB Amira (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany) software package (Stalling, Westerhoff and Hege, 2005; Lindow et al., 2021). After converting the image data into TIFF format, the image registration was manually refined in Fiji TrakEM2., followed by a final elastic alignment. Segmentation of cellular features was performed manually with the program VAST (Berger, Seung and Lichtman, 2018) and subsequently rendered in Blender (Brito, 2018). All movies were generated using Amira.",

    "title": "Visualization of cellular membrane damage and apoptosis in murine precision cut lung slices after vibratome slicing",
    "release_date": "2024-07-22",
    "description": "Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) are increasingly being utilized to reduce animal usage (as more experiments can be performed on complex and multicellular tissues from a single animal) but also offer the potential to study cellular and tissue level processes directly in human tissue ex vivo. PCLS can be generated using several different techniques including a vibrating microtome (vibratome) or other commercial devices such as a Krumdieck slicer or Compresstome. Due to the potential damage from mechanical cutting of the tissue and from the cold ischemic time associated with tissue preparation, some labs report letting PCLS rest overnight or for 24 hours prior to starting experiments. However, there is limited data on what occurs immediately after slicing and what time window is optimal for PCLS recovery prior to the start of experiments. This is particularly important to determine if PCLS are to be used for evaluation of targeted therapies, such as nanoparticle therapies. Non-specific uptake due to cell membrane damage may obfuscate the interpretation of results. Previous papers in the PCLS field have utilized live/dead staining which relies on Calcein AM staining which is cleaved cleaved by intracellular esterases to yield Calcein fluorescence, which is only retained in live cells. In parallel, Ethidium homodimer I (or III) are used to label dead or dying cells as this dye is impermeant to intact cell membranes. Ethidium homodimer is weakly fluorescent at baseline but becomes highly fluorescent when complexed with nucleic acids. However, this approach has several drawbacks. 1) It does not yield insight into whether cell damage detected with Calcein AM is due to apoptosis or necrosis 2) Both dyes have excitation and emission spectra in ranges that overlap with lung tissue autofluorescence (Calcein AM ex=494nm and em=514nm; EtHD ex 527nm and em=624nm). Therefore, we sought to establish the feasibility of utilizing an active caspase3/7 sensitive dye (NucView\u00ae488) and a far red cell impermeable dye which more specifically labels nuclei (RedDot\u21222) to complement the information available in the literature to better understand the early dynamics in PCLS. These results help to establish suitable time windows for letting PCLS recover prior to beginning experiments, provide insight into the potential for apoptotic pathways to be initiated after slicing and help to establish when such live staining agents should be administered to evaluate potential cell death. We generated 300\u03bcm thick PCLS from agarose filled murine lungs and either immediately administered apoptosis/necrosis dyes or administered them 24 hours later. To test for dye stability and as a positive control for cellular damage, we administered 150\u03bcM hydrogen peroxide to some slices. Images were acquired using confocal microscopy using identical laser and microscope settings over multiple days. There was no internal calibration performed between days. ",

Following cannulation, pre-warmed solutions of 1.5% agarose in DMEM/F12 at ~41-42 degrees Celsius were slowly infused until the lung was completely inflated (around 2.5-3mL). The lungs were then placed into a refrigerator (4 degrees celsius) to allow the agarose to solidify for around 30 minutes. Individual lobes were then separated using surgical scissors at the level of major airways and glued onto vibratome stubs using Loctite. 300\u00b5M thick PCLS were prepared using a vibratome (Campden Instruments,7000smz-2). Ciliary beating was routinely assessed prior to any treatment as a surrogate for PCLS viability using a 20x ELWD objective in a Nikon Eclipse Ts2R microscope equipped with a highspeed camera (Imaging Source, DFK 33UX264).",

    "title": "Identification of a Repressive Type of TF Condensation and Engineering a Glue Peptide Therapy Against Cancer",
    "release_date": "2024-08-24",
    "description": "Transcriptional factors (TFs) act as key determinants of the coordination of cell death and survival by differentially modulating gene expression. Here, we systematically identified many TFs including condensate-forming TEAD4 in stressed cells. In sharp contrast to YAP-induced transcription-activating condensation of TEAD4, we found that co-factors such as VGLL4 and RFXANK could alternatively induce repressive condensation of TEAD4 to trigger cell death. Illustrated using VGLL4 as the cofactor, we mechanistically revealed that the heterotypic interactions between TEAD4 and VGLL4 favor the oligomerization and assembly of large condensates of TEAD4 to manifest a nonclassical inhibitory function of this transcription factor, i.e., causing DNA/chromatin to be aggregated and entangled, which eventually impede gene expression. Based on these findings, we engineered a linker peptide to selectively \u201cglue\u201d TEAD4 molecules together, thereby forcefully driving its condensation-induced repression of YAP-induced activation. This glue peptide displayed a strong antitumor effect via inhibition of TEAD4-related gene transcription. Collectively, this work revealed a new type of phase separation, i.e., repressive condensation of TFs, revealed how cofactor-induced differential condensation can orchestrate opposite functions of a given TF, and further developed a new class of antitumor strategies involving artificially inducing repressive condensation.

Patient-derived cells (PDCs) were established as described previously. All cells were maintained in culture supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For immunofluorescence assays, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min. Images of cells incubated with primary and secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were captured using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope with a 63 \u00d7 oil immersion lens. Twenty-five cells were scanned and analyzed using Fiji ImageJ software. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed by adding to them a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 400 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The fixative was replaced by washing the cells with 0.15 M glycine in PBS 3 times for 5 min each to quench free aldehyde. Cells were then scraped and subjected to centrifugation in order to collect them in 1% gelatin. Pellets were embedded in 12% gelatin, solidified in ice and cut into 1 mm3 blocks on a cold plate. The small blocks were immersed in 2.3 M sucrose and the immersion was rotated at 4\u00b0C overnight and transferred to an aluminium specimen holder and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections (70 nm) of the transferred material were cut at \u2212115 \u00b0C using an ultramicrotome and mounted on 100-mesh formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids. These cryosections were immune-labelled with the primary antibody and secondary antibody. After being labeled, the sections were counterstained with methylcellulose/uranyl acetate for 7 min, and imaged using an electron microscope at 120 kV.\n",

    "description": "In this study, we found that mice lacking gut microbiota displayed increased blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier permeability associated with disorganized tight junctions (TJs), which can be rescued by recolonization with gut microbiota or supplementation with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We further confirmed that the vagus nerve plays an important role in this process but SCFAs can also bypass the vagus nerve and affect blood-CSF barrier functionality. Strikingly, the administration of SCFAs in AppNL-G-F AD mice also improved the localization of TJs in the blood-CSF barrier. This was accompanied by a pronounced reduction in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden, which could be achieved by regulating microglial phenotype. Altogether, our results suggest that modulating the microbiota or administering SCFAs might have therapeutic potential in AD via tightening blood-CSF barrier and maintaining microglial activity.",

            "protocol_description": "Primary mouse choroid plexus epithelial cells were isolated from P2-P7 pups as previously described (Balusu, Van Wonterghem et al., 2016). Choroid plexus tissue was isolated from the lateral and fourth ventricles, pooled and digested with pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 min. For monolayer cultures, cells were plated on 24-well plate or Transwell polyester inserts (pore size, 0.4 \u03bcm; surface area, 33.6 mm2; Corning) coated with laminin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 to 2 weeks until their trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values reached a plateau.\n\nFor immunostainings on brain sections, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS. Subsequently, brains were carefully separated from the skull and split into two halves (mid-sagittal). The right hemispheres were embedded in Frozen Section Medium (Thermo Scientific) immediately in cryomolds (Sakura) that were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. The left hemispheres were post-fixed overnight with 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0C. After dehydration, samples were embedded in paraffin in cryomolds and stored at RT until further use. The brains were cut into 5\u2009\u03bcm slices paraffin sections (HM 340 E, Thermo Scientific) or 20\u2009\u03bcm cryosections (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Scientific). These brain samples were cut from the sagittal superior sinus towards the border of the cerebral hemisphere. Sections were collected serially for TJ staining when the choroid plexus was initially present and and for other staining when the entire hippocampus was initially present (Fig S13). One section per mouse was analyzed. For immunofluorescence staining, sections were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.3-0.5% Triton X-100. Following being blocked with goat immunomix (GIM) (5% goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.3-0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) at RT for 1 h, sections were incubated with primary Abs in GIM at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBS, sections were stained with fluorophore-conjugated secondary Abs in PBS or PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at RT for 1-1.5 h. Counterstaining was done with Hoechst reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1000 in PBS). Primary antibody Occludin (cat. no. 33-1500, Thermo Scientific); E-cadherin (cat. no. 610181, BD Biosciences); IBA1 (cat. no. 019-19741, Wako); GFAP (cat. no. ab53554, Abcam); Synaptophysin (cat. no. ab32127); PSD-95 (cat. no. MA1-045, Thermo Scientific) and 6E10 (cat. no. 803001, Biolegend) were used on paraffin sections; ZO-1 (cat. no. 61-7300, Thermo Scientific) and Claudin-1 (cat. no. 51-9000, Thermo Scientific) were used on cryosections; CD31 (cat. no. DIA-310, Dianova) was used on both paraffin sections and cryosections. For immunostainings on primary cells, cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 20 min on ice. Next, cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. Samples were washed with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS) and incubated with primary Abs (diluted in blocking buffer) for 2 h at RT/overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBS, cells were stained with fluorophore-conjugated secondary Abs in PBS for 1 h at RT. Next, samples were counterstained with Hoechst and the sections were mounted.",

    "description": "Mitophagy is a form of selective autophagy that disposes of superfluous and potentially damage-inducing organelles in a tightly controlled manner. While the machinery involved in mitophagy induction is well known, the regulation of the components is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that TNIP1 knock out accelerates mitophagy rates, and that ectopic TNIP1 negatively regulates the rate of mitophagy. These functions of TNIP1 depend on an evolutionarily conserved LIR motif as well as an AHD3 domain, which are required for binding to the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins and the autophagy receptor TAX1BP1, respectively. We further show that phosphorylation appears to regulate its association with the ULK1 complex member FIP200, allowing TNIP1 to compete with autophagy receptors, providing a molecular rationale for its inhibitory function during mitophagy. Taken together, our findings identify a novel negative regulator of mitophagy that acts at the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis. ",

    "release_date": "2023-02-08",
    "description": "Bacteria encounter polymeric nutrient sources that need to be processed to support growth. Bacillus subtilis is a bacterium known for its adaptability and resilience within the rhizosphere and broader soil environment. Here we explore the role that a suite of extracellular proteases plays in supporting growth of B. subtilis when an extracellular heterologous protein (BSA) provides an abundant, but polymeric, food source. We confirm the essential role of extracellular proteases in this context and note the influence of the polymeric nutrient concentration on the yield of growth, but not on the relative level of extracellular proteases. We demonstrate the collective action of the extracellular proteases in supporting B. subtilis growth and evidence their use as a shared public good. Furthermore, we show that B. subtilis is subjected to a public good dilemma, but only in the context of using a polymeric food source. Using mathematical simulations, we uncover that this dilemma is driven by the relative cost of producing the public good. Collectively, our findings reveal how B. subtilis can survive in environments that vary significantly in terms of immediate nutrient accessibility. This information should inform steps to improve its efficacy as a biofertilizer in agricultural settings.",

    "description": "The plant immune system relies on the perception of molecules that signal the presence of a microbe threat. This triggers signal transduction that mediates a range of cellular responses via a collection of molecular machinery including receptors, small molecules, and enzymes. One response to pathogen perception is the restriction of cell-to-cell communication by plasmodesmal closure. We previously found that while chitin and flg22 trigger specialized immune signaling cascades in the plasmodesmal plasma membrane, both execute plasmodesmal closure via callose synthesis at the plasmodesmata. This indicates the signaling pathways ultimately converge at or upstream of callose synthesis. To establish the hierarchy of signaling at plasmodesmata and characterize points of convergence in microbe elicitor-triggered signaling, we profiled the dependence of plasmodesmal responses triggered by different elicitors on a range of plasmodesmal signaling machinery. We identified that, like chitin, flg22 signals via RBOHD to induce plasmodesmal closure. Further, we found that PDLP1, PDLP5 and CALS1 are common to microbe- and SA-triggered responses, identifying PDLPs as a candidate signaling nexus. To understand how PDLPs relay a signal to CALS1, we screened for PDLP5 interactors and found NHL3, which is also required for chitin-, flg22- and SA-triggered plasmodesmal responses and PDLP-mediated activation of callose synthesis. We conclude that a PDLP-NHL3 complex acts as an integrating node of plasmodesmal signaling cascades, transmitting multiple immune signals to activate CALS1 and plasmodesmata closure.",

    "release_date": "2023-04-21",
    "description": "Preventing parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes is recognised to be critical for achieving elimination and eradication of malaria. Consequently developing new antimalarial drugs with transmission-blocking properties is a priority. Large screening campaigns have identified many new transmission-blocking molecules, however little is known about how they target transmissible Plasmodium falciparum stage V gametocytes, or how they affect their underlying cell biology. To respond to this knowledge gap, we have developed a machine learning image analysis pipeline to characterise and compare the cellular phenotypes generated by transmission-blocking molecules during male gametogenesis. Using this approach, we studied 40 molecules, categorising their activity based upon timing of action and visual effects on the organisation of tubulin and DNA in the cell. Our data both proposes new modes of action and corroborates existing modes of action of identified transmission-blocking molecules. Furthermore, the characterised molecules provide a new armoury of tool compounds to probe gametocyte cell biology and the generated imaging dataset provides a new reference for researchers to correlate molecular target or gene deletion to specific cellular phenotype. Our analysis pipeline is not optimised for a specific organism and could be applied to any fluorescence microscopy dataset containing cells delineated by bounding boxes, and so is extendible to any disease model.",

Gametocytes were induced by seeding culture flasks at 2% parasitaemia/4% haematocrit and subjecting them to daily medium changes for 14 days whilst maintaining a temperature of 37\u00b0C at all times. On Day 14, the maturity of gametocytes was assessed by quantifying male gametogenesis (exflagellation). A 20 \u00b5l sample of gametocyte culture was mixed with equal volume of ookinete medium (complete culture medium supplemented with 0.1 \u00b5M xanthurenic acid) at room temperature and transferred to a haemocytometer. After 20 min at room temperature, exflagellation was accurately quantified as described in Delves et al. 2016. Cultures possessing >0.2% exflagellation (including uninfected erythrocytes) were selected for downstream assays.\n\nMature gametocyte cultures were divided into 100 \u00b5l \u201cmicrocultures\u201d in pre-warmed 1.5 ml tubes also containing 100 \u00b5l complete culture medium with test compounds at a final concentration of 10xIC50 or 0.5% DMSO as a solvent control. Tubes were gassed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. The entire compound library was screened once, spread over four different experiments, each with two DMSO control tubes. An 8% formaldehyde solution was prepared by diluting 16% methanol-free formaldehyde in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In each experiment, one DMSO control tube was fixed with equal volume of 8% formaldehyde (4% final concentration) at 37 \u00b0C to provide an \u201cunactivated\u201d gametocyte control. Gametogenesis was then triggered in the remaining DMSO control tube and all compound tubes by adding 10 \u00b5l ookinete medium, and they were immediately incubated at room temperature. After 20 min (when exflagellation is maximal), all remaining tubes were fixed for 30 min."

            "protocol_description": "Mice\nWild type mice (C57BL/6J) were harvested at E14.5.\n\n\nDissection and organotypic slice preparation\nMice pregnant with E14.5 embryos were sacrificed via cervical dislocation for litter harvesting. Embryos were transferred into ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), decapitated, and heads collected in ice-cold PBS for ex utero electroporation. For microinjection, heads of embryos were dissected in pre-warmed Tyrode\u2019s solution (37\u00b0C) for organotypic slice preparation as previously described (Taverna et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2014). 250 \u00b5m vibratome sections were prepared and transferred into pre-warmed slice culture medium (SCM) (Taverna et al., 2012). The composition of the SCM is as follows: Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany), 10% rat serum (Charles River, Japan), 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Penstrep (Thermo Fisher Scientific), N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.3. Before the start of microinjection, brain slices were transferred to 3.5 cm dishes containing 37\u00b0C warm CO2-independent microinjection medium (CIMM: DMEM-F12 (Sigma, Germany, D2906), 2 mM L-glutamine, Penstrep, N2 and B27 supplements, 25 mM (final concentration), Hepes-NaOH pH 7.3).\n\n\nFixation, embedding, and sectioning\nFixation, embedding, and sectioning were performed as described (Taverna et al., 2012; Gray de Cristoforis et al., 2020). Hemispheres or slices were washed twice with PBS to remove culture media, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 120 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at room temperature for 30 min followed by 4\u00b0C overnight. Following fixation, hemispheres and slices were washed thrice with 1X PBS. Coronal sections (50 \u00b5m) were prepared from microinjected slices on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). All slices were collected in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C for subsequent immunofluorescence staining. Electroporated hemisphereswere infiltrated with 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C overnight prior to embedding in TissueTek tissue freezing medium (Leica Biosystems, Germany). 16 \u00b5m-thick sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems) and resulting sections were stored at -20\u00b0C for further processing.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\nFloating sections were processed for immunofluorescence (IF) staining as previously described (Taverna et al., 2012). In brief, sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100 (Carl Roth, Germany) in PBS for 30 min, followed by quenching in 0.2 M glycine buffer pH 7.4 for 30 min. The sections were washed three times with IF buffer, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in IF buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, sections were washed 5 times for 5 min each time with IF buffer. Secondary antibodies were diluted in IF buffer with DAPI (Carl Roth, Germany) as nuclear counterstain. Sections were incubated at room temperature for 1 h followed by washing (5 times 5 min each) with IF buffer and then PBS. \n\nStained sections were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma, Germany) and imaged. Cryosections were processed for IF staining as follows. Sections were dried for 5 min in a chemical hood then washed twice with 1X PBS, followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton-X100 (Carl Roth, Germany) in PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, sections were incubated  solution (10% Normal Donkey Serum, in 0.3% TritonX-100/PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were incubated with the sections overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by washing 5 times for 5 min each time with 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution with DAPI as nuclear counterstain for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing for 5 times 5 min each time.\n\nMicroscopy and figure preparation\nImaging was performed with a widefield fluorescence (Zeiss Axio Imager M2; Zeiss) microscope. Image shown is 1 \u00b5m-thick single optical section. Confocal images were taken at either 63X or 40X magnifications. Immunofluorescence images of single optical sections were quantified using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012). Final image panels were processed with Inkscape 1.0.2, Adobe Illustrator CS5.1 or Affinity publisher 1.10.5. ",

Day 1 adult females with arrested oocytes were then mated or not with an abundance of males at 20\u00baC for 1.5 hr prior to imaging.\nFor live imaging of embryos, five young adults were transferred to 10 \u03bcL of L-15 media on a coverslip and dissected to release embryos. 20 \u03bcm polystyrene beads were then added to prevent compression, and the coverslip was inverted onto a microscope slide (Thermo Fisher cat # 12-550-403).

    "title": "Senescent Schwann cells induced by aging and chronic denervation impair axonal regeneration after peripheral nerve injury",
    "release_date": "2023-03-17",
    "description": "After peripheral nerve injuries, successful axonal growth and functional recovery requires the reprogramming of Schwann cells into a reparative phenotype, a process dependent on the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun. Nevertheless, axonal regeneration is greatly impaired in aged organisms or after chronic denervation leading to important clinical problems. This regenerative failure has been associated to a diminished c-Jun expression by Schwann cells, but whether the inability of these cells to maintain a repair state is associated to the transition into a phenotype inhibitory for axonal growth, has not been evaluated so far. We find that repair Schwann cells transitions into a senescent phenotype, characterized by diminished c-Jun expression and secretion of factor inhibitory for axonal regeneration in both aging and chronic denervation. In both conditions, elimination of senescent Schwann cells by systemic senolytic drug treatment or genetic targeting improves nerve regeneration and functional recovery in aging and chronic denervation, associated with an upregulation of c-Jun expression and a decrease in nerve inflammation. This work provides the first characterization of senescent Schwann cells and their impact over axonal regeneration in aging and chronic denervation, opening new avenues for enhancing regeneration, and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries.",

Expression analysis was performed using a custom TaqMan\u00ae Array FAST plate (Applied Biosystems), specifically against senescence (p16, p21, p51, LaminB1, Trp53bp1) and SCs (c-Jun, Krox-20, mbp) transcripts (see Table 5).

    "title": "Development of a shortwave infrared (SWIR) sinuscope for the detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks.",
    "release_date": "2023-03-21",
    "description": "Significance: CSF rhinorrhea (leakage of brain fluid from the nose) can be difficult to identify and currently requires invasive procedures such as intrathecal fluorescein which requires a lumbar drain placement. Fluorescein is also known to have rare but significant side effects including seizures and death. As the number of endonasal skull base cases increase, the number of CSF leaks have also increased for which an alternative diagnostic method would be highly advantageous to patients.\nAim:  To develop an instrument to identify CSF leaks based on water absorption in the SWIR without the need of intrathecal contrast agents. This device needed to be adapted to the anatomy of the human nasal cavity while maintaining low weight and ergonomic characteristics of current surgical instruments.\nApproach: Absorption spectra of CSF and artificial CSF were obtained to characterize the absorption peaks that could be targeted with SWIR light. Different illumination systems were tested and refined prior to adapting them into a portable endoscope for testing in 3D printed models and cadavers for feasibility. \nResults: We identified CSF to have an identical absorption profile as water. In our testing, a narrow band laser source at 1480nm proved superior to using a broad 1450 nm LED. Using a SWIR enabling endoscope set up, we tested the ability to detect artificial CSF in a cadaver model.\nConclusions: An endoscopic system based on SWIR narrow band imaging can provide an alternative in the future to invasive methods of CSF leak detection.",

    "description": "FAM3C/ILEI is an important cytokine for tumor progression and metastasis. However, its involvement in inflammation remains elusive. Here, we show that ILEI protein is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions. Inducible keratinocyte-specific ILEI overexpression in mice (K5-ILEIind) recapitulates many aspects of psoriasis following TPA challenge, primarily manifested by impaired epidermal differentiation and increased neutrophil recruitment. Mechanistically, ILEI triggers Erk and Akt signaling, which then activate STAT3 via Ser727 phosphorylation. Keratinocyte-specific ILEI deletion ameliorates TPA-induced skin inflammation. A transcriptomic ILEI signature obtained from the K5-ILEIind model shows enrichment in several signaling pathways also found in psoriasis and identifies urokinase as a targetable enzyme to counteract ILEI activity. Pharmacological inhibition of urokinase in TPA-induced K5-ILEIind mice results in significant improvement of psoriasiform symptoms by reducing ILEI secretion. The ILEI signature distinguishes psoriasis from healthy skin with uPA ranking among the top \u201cseparator\u201d genes. Our study identifies ILEI as a key driver in psoriasis, indicates the relevance of ILEI-regulated genes for disease manifestation and shows the clinical impact of ILEI and urokinase as novel potential therapeutic targets in psoriasis.",

    "title": "The FMRF-NH2 Gated Sodium Channel of Biomphalaria glabrata: Localization and Expression Following Infection by Schistosoma mansoni",
    "release_date": "2023-04-03",
    "description": "The neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis impacts over 700 million people globally. Schistosoma mansoni, the trematode parasite that causes the most common type of schistosomiasis, requires planorbid pond snails of the genus Biomphalaria to support its larval development and transformation to the cercarial form that can infect humans.  A greater understanding of neural signaling systems that are specific to the Biomphalaria intermediate host could lead to novel strategies for parasite or snail control.  This study examined a Biomphalaria glabrata neural channel that is gated by the neuropeptide FMRF-NH2. The Biomphalaria glabrata FMRF-NH2 gated sodium channel (Bgl-FaNaC) amino acid sequence was highly conserved with FaNaCs found in related gastropods, especially the planorbid Planorbella trivolvis (91% sequence identity). In common with the P. trivolvis FaNaC, the B. glabrata channel exhibited a low affinity (EC50: 3 x 10-4 M) and high specificity for the FMRF-NH2 agonist. Its expression in the central nervous system, detected with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, was widespread, with the protein localized mainly to neuronal fibers and the mRNA confined to cell bodies. Colocalization of the Bgl-FaNaC message with its FMRF-NH2 agonist precursor occurred in some neurons associated with male mating behavior.  At the mRNA level, Bgl-FaNaC expression was decreased at 20 and 35 days post infection (dpi) by S. mansoni.  Increased expression of the transcript encoding the FMRF-NH2 agonist at 35 dpi was proposed to reflect a compensatory response to decreased receptor levels. Altered FMRF-NH2 signaling could be vital for parasite proliferation in its intermediate host and may therefore present innovative opportunities for snail control. ",

Islets were washed three times in cytoskeleton buffer before fixation overnight in a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0C. Coverslips containing adhered and fixed islets were transferred into 0.1% tannic acid in ultrapure water for 20 minutes at room temperature. Following this, samples were rinsed 4 times for 5 minutes each in ultrapure water and incubated in 0.2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 20 minutes. Samples were rinsed 3 times for 10 minutes each in ultrapure water and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% x3) for 5 minutes in each step. Once dehydrated, samples were loaded into a critical point drier (Leica EM CPD 300, Vienna, Austria) which was set to perform 12 CO2 exchanges at the slowest speed.

    "description": "The conversion of STAT proteins from latent to active transcription factors is central to cytokine signalling. Triggered by their signal-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, it is the assembly of a range of cytokine-specific STAT homo- and heterodimers that marks a key step in the transition of hitherto latent proteins to transcription activators. In contrast, the constitutive self-assembly of latent STATs and how it relates to the functioning of activated STATs, is understood less well. To provide a more complete picture, we developed a co-localisation-based assay and tested all 28 possible combinations of the seven unphosphorylated STAT proteins in living cells. It led to the identification of five U-STAT homodimers \u2015STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A and STAT5B\u2015 and two heterodimers \u2015STAT1:STAT2 and STAT5A:STAT5B\u2015 as well as semi-quantitative assessments of the forces and characterisations of binding interfaces that support them. One STAT protein \u2015STAT6\u2015 was found to be monomeric. This comprehensive analysis of latent STAT self-assembly lays bare considerable structural and functional diversity in the ways that link STAT dimerization before and after activation.",

        "description": "The STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of seven transcription factors in mammals, namely STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. These proteins are the substrate of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Janus kinases (JAK), which catalyse their phosphorylation of a single C-terminal tyrosine residue after ligand binding to cell surface receptors. About 50 different growth factors and cytokines including interferons, interleukins and growth hormones are known to signal via STAT proteins. The activated STATs accumulate in the nucleus and participate in the transcription of hundreds of genes. This sequence of events, usually referred to as canonical JAK-STAT signalling, entails the dimerization of STAT proteins through mutual phosphotyrosine:SH2 domain interactions. Such dimers can bind short palindromic stretches of DNA called GAS elements in the promoter region of target genes. In addition to homodimers, activated STATs can assemble heterodimers with the other family members. While the phosphotyrosine-mediated functions of STATs were linked to their dimerization early on, much less is known to date regarding the constitutive self-assembly of latent, that is unphosphorylated STATs (U-STATs). Initially, U-STATs were believed to be monomeric, but further studies showed that STATs can assemble high molecular weight complexes already before tyrosine phosphorylation. A well-documented example is STAT1, which forms equally strong dimers before and after activation as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, crystallographic evidence demonstrates that unphosphorylated dimers of STAT1; STAT3 and STAT5 are stabilized not by interactions of the carboxy-terminal SH2 domains, but by interactions between amino terminal regions, resulting in antiparallel orientation of monomers as opposed to their parallel orientation in the phosphodimers. It has been recognized that unphosphorylated STATs are involved in many biological events in both normal and pathological situations. In some instances, the self-assembly of U-STAT has been linked to tyrosine phosphorylation and cytokine signalling. For example, the homodimerization of U-STAT4 is a prerequisite for cytokine-induced STAT4 activation, and heterodimerization of U-STAT1 with U-STAT2 has been shown to have positive or negative consequences for type 1 and type 2 interferon signalling, respectively. These and other findings indicate that U-STAT dimers fulfil roles critical for cytokine functioning, but the knowledge of dimerization before cytokine-induced phosphorylation remains incomplete. This is particularly true for heterotypic interactions across the STAT family and the in-vivo situation generally. To fill in knowledge gaps, we devised an assay to explore systematically the repertoires of homo- and heterotypic interactions among U-STATs in living cells. The assay is based on U-STATs being nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that can freely cross the soft diffusion barrier posed by the nuclear pore, presumably via direct contacts with nuclear pore proteins. It results in generally pancellular distributions of U-STATs, which for STAT1 and STAT2 can be shifted to nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation by tagging them with transferable carrier-dependent nuclear localisation (NLS) or nuclear export (NES) signals. We reasoned that tagged variants thus could function as baits that attract co-expressed test proteins if binding interactions occurred. This would be evident by their co-localization in the bait protein\u2019s compartment. After rigorous testing and verification, this approach was used to probe homo-and heterotypic binding interactions within cells across the entire STAT family for the first time. ",

All pixel values were measured below saturation limits.\n\nThe assay scores the extent of co-localisation of a cytoplasmic or nuclear accumulated STAT protein (STAT-NES or STAT-NLS), which functions as the bait, with another STAT, the test protein, whereby the two proteins are fused to different fluorophores. We used mCherry and mEGFP, as they are monomeric, and their emission spectra display minimal overlap. Co-localisation is taken as a proxy for the degree of dimerization via homo- or heterotypic interactions. In the basic assay configuration, wild-type STAT proteins were tested. To assess dimer conformation, we tested single point mutants homologous to key interacting residues of STAT1 (F77 or L78), which are critical for the assembly of antiparallel dimers of the unphosphorylated protein. To assess dimer stability, bait and test proteins were furnished with opposed translocation signals (STAT-NES co-expressed with STAT-NLS) to provide forces that counteract the association of the two protomers in STAT dimers. For all assay configurations, knowledge of the relative cellular expression levels of the two co-expressed STAT proteins is necessary to ensure bait proteins are present in excess. As the STATs were expressed as fusions with mEGFP or mCherry, information about their relative expression levels could be obtained by comparison with a mEGFP-mCherry fusion protein, which expressed mEGFP and mCherry fluorophores in a known and fixed ratio of one-to-one. To facilitate quantification of the co-localisation assay, all images were acquired using exposure times calibrated such that the mEGFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities were approximately equal. We found that this acquisition setting reproducibly gave equivalent readings even when used on different days. Using these setting, cells were imaged, and single cells were manually segmented in ImageJ. Cells were eligible for quantitative co-localization analyses if the bait STAT protein was present from equimolar amounts to up to 4-fold molar excess compared to the co-expressed test variant. To obtain quantitative estimates of the degree of co-localization in the images, Pearson (rP) and Spearman (rS, given in the source data files) correlation coefficients were calculated for individual cells with the PSC co-localization ImageJ plug-in as described. Both tests produce values in the range [\u22121, 1], 0 indicating that there is no discernible correlation and \u22121 and +1 meaning strong negative and positive correlations, respectively. Cells where fewer than 1000 pixels had intensity values above that which might be considered image noise for at least one of the channels at that data point were also deemed ineligible and excluded from further calculations. The PSC programme\u2019s default intensity setting of 40 was used as the image noise threshold. Values for Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for 10-30 eligible cells per experiment and are given as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). "

            "protocol_description": "Cell culture and transfections\nHeLa (ECACC 93021013) and HEK293 (ECACC 85120602) cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma D6429), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma F9665) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma P0781; with 10,000 units penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin per mL in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl), in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u02daC. Cells were transfected at ~80% confluence using Lipofectamine LTX according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Invitrogen) with the following modifications. For co-localisation assays, HeLa cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 1.2 \u00b5g DNA, 2 \u00b5l lipofectamine and 2 \u00b5l PLUS reagent per well, whereby DNA encoding the bait protein was used in about 2-fold excess. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB; Cell Signaling Technology) to inactivate NES-mediated nuclear export. \n\nExpression constructs\nSTAT proteins were expressed with mCherry or mEGFP fused to the C-terminus through cloning into pmCherry-N1 (Clontech) and pmEGFP-N1 (derived from pEGFP-N1, encoding A206K mutant of EGFP, Clontech), respectively. Cytoplasmic or nuclear accumulation of fusion proteins was achieved by appending canonical nuclear export (NES) or nuclear import (NLS) signal sequences. We used the NES from protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI, 34NSNELALKLAGLDINK49) and the NLS from simian virus 40 large T-antigen (SV40, 126PKKKRKV132). Where a single signal was appended, the respective cDNA sequence was placed between STAT and fluorophore, encoding additional 3-5 heterologous residues N- and C-terminal of the NES or NLS sequence. To express STAT1 with dual NES and NLS signals, plasmid pSTAT1-NES-mEGFP was used and the SV40 NLS (plus an additional C-terminal glutamate residue) was placed downstream of the fluorophore. STAT2\u0394C is a C-terminally truncated variant expressing residues 1-703. N-domain mutations were as follows, STAT1-F77A, STAT2-L82A, STAT3-L78R, STAT4-L78S, STAT5A-L82A, STAT5B-L82A. Plasmid pmEGFP-mCherry encoded mEGFP fused to the N-terminus of mCherry. The two fluorophores were linked via an extended rigid helical linker (1YSDLELAEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKAAARDPPVAT42) to minimize basal F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer. The mutations were introduced using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs). Sequences of all the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

    "description": "Extracting biological information from awake and unrestrained mice is imperative to in vivo basic and pre-clinical research. Accordingly, imaging methods which preclude invasiveness, anesthesia, and/or physical restraint enable more physiologically relevant biological data extraction by eliminating these extrinsic confounders. In this article we discuss the recent development of shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescent imaging to visualize peripheral organs in freely-behaving mice, as well as propose potential applications of this imaging modality in the neurosciences.",

    "description": "Fluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a key method for observing protein distribution, dynamics, and interaction with other proteins in living cells. However, the typical approach using overexpression of tagged proteins can perturb cell behavior and introduce localization artifacts. To preserve native expression, fluorescent proteins can be inserted directly into endogenous genes. This approach has been widely used in yeast for decades, and more recently in invertebrate model organisms with the advent of CRISPR/Cas9. However, endogenous FP tagging has not been widely used in mammalian cells due to inefficient homology-directed repair. Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

To validate the quality of the SMLM reconstructions by quantitative error mapping of super-resolution images we used the NanoJ-SQUIRREL package (Culley et al., 2018; Schindelin et al., 2012) in FIJI. For Fourier ring correlation (FRC) analysis, 20 000 images from the time series were split into odd and even frames, which were used to reconstruct super-resolution images in ThunderSTORM. Images were then merged into a stack in FIJI and used as the input for the FRC analysis in NanoJ-SQUIRREL. Density-based cluster analysis was performed in the SMAP environment (Ries, 2020). For the clustering analysis, the super-resolution reconstructions were first processed by the density calculator (counting neighbours for each localization in a circle < 12 nm), which was then used to filter out localizations in lowest-density regions. Subsequently, we calculated the number of clusters using DBscan, using the SMAP implementation of the algorithm by Caetano et al., 2015; with the minimum number of objects in the neighbourhood set to 7; the neighbouring radius set to 20. 3D surface projections were rendered using the Imaris software (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments)."

For the staining of actin filaments, sections on coverslips were first washed two times in 1x PBST (0.05% Tween-20), blocked for 30 minutes in 3% BSA in 1x PBST and incubated with 150 nM Phalloidin-AF647 (#A22287, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 3% BSA / PBST for 30 minutes in a humid chamber. Samples were then rinsed 3x in 1x PBST and imaged in the imaging buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 50 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethylamine (MEA, 30070, Sigma-Aldrich), 1.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase (G2133, Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 \u00b5g/ml catalase (C40, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in Chamlide magnetic holder cells (#CM-B25-1; Live Cell Instrument). For immunolabelling of histone H3, sections on coverslips were first blocked for 30 minutes in 3% BSA in 1x PBST, then incubated with anti-H3 antibody (1:100 dilution, #ab1791, Abcam) in BSA / PBST overnight (#ab1791; Abcam) followed by rinse in 1x PBST and incubation with Alexa Fluor Plus 555 secondary antibody (1:200 dilution, #A32732, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 minutes at room temperature prior to final wash in 1x PBST.    \n\nFluorescence light microscopy\n\nThe images of 500 nm thick root sections were acquired on the Nikon CSU-W1 confocal spinning disk microscope. Time-lapse dSTORM imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti-E microscope with a Nikon CFI HP Apo TIRF 100x oil objective (1.49 NA, detection with EM CCD Andor iXon Ultra DU897 camera) and on Zeiss Elyra 7 (Carl Zeiss, GmBH) imaging system with a 63x Oil Plan-Apochromat oil objective (1.46 NA, detection with PCO edge 4.2 sCMOS camera) in the HILO mode. For SMLM of whole-mount samples, roots were immobilized on poly-L-lysine coated high-precision coverslips and mounted in an imaging buffer (as described above). For SMLM of sections, 500 nm and 1000 nm thick root sections were anchored to 22x22 mm high-precision poly-L-lysine coated coverslips, mounted in Chamlide holder cells and imaged as described above.\n",

    "release_date": "2023-06-15",
    "description": "Hepatocytes form bile canaliculi that dynamically respond to the signalling activity of bile acids and bile flow. Little is known about their responses to intraluminal pressure. During embryonic development, hepatocytes assemble apical bulkheads that increase the canalicular resistance to intraluminal pressure. Here, we investigated if they may also protect bile canaliculi against elevated pressure upon impaired bile flow in adult liver. Apical bulkheads accumulate upon bile flow obstruction in mouse models and patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Their loss under these conditions leads to abnormally dilated canaliculi, resembling liver cell rosettes described in other hepatic diseases. 3D reconstruction revealed that these structures are sections of cysts and tubes formed by hepatocytes. Mathematical modelling established that they positively correlate with canalicular pressure and occur early in PSC. Using primary hepatocytes and 3D organoids, we demonstrated that excessive canalicular pressure causes the loss of apical bulkheads and formation of rosettes. Our results suggest that apical bulkheads are a protective mechanism of hepatocytes against impaired bile flow, highlighting the role of canalicular pressure in liver diseases.",

    "title": "Cell fragmentation in mouse preimplantation embryos induced by ectopic activation of the polar body extrusion pathway",
    "release_date": "2023-07-09",
    "description": "Cell fragmentation is commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and is associated with poor prognosis during assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. However, the mechanisms leading to cell fragmentation remain largely unknown. Here, light sheet microscopy imaging of mouse embryos reveals that inefficient chromosome separation due to spindle defects, caused by dysfunctional molecular motors Myo1c or dynein, leads to fragmentation during mitosis. Extended exposure of the cell cortex to chromosomes locally triggers actomyosin contractility and pinches off cell fragments. This process is reminiscent of meiosis, during which small GTPase-mediated signals from chromosomes coordinate polar body extrusion (PBE) by actomyosin contraction. By interfering with the signals driving PBE, we find that this meiotic signaling pathway remains active during cleavage stages and is both required and sufficient to trigger fragmentation. Together, we find that fragmentation happens in mitosis after ectopic activation of actomyosin contractility by signals emanating from DNA, similar to those observed during meiosis. Our study uncovers the mechanisms underlying fragmentation in preimplantation embryos and, more generally, offers insight into the regulation of mitosis during the maternal-zygotic transition.",

A segmented line is used to define the size and the location of the LifeAct or Myh9-GFP cap. Starting at the first division timepoint the intensity is measured at the segmented line, with the length of the eventually formed cap, and the distance between the center of the DNA mass and the center of the segmented line. The intensity of another segmented line drawn with the same length on a different part of the cell-medium interface where no cortical fluctuations are observed is used to normalize the intensity. \n\nSpindle analysis\nSpindle persistence was calculated by measuring the time between the appearance and disappearance of the spindle. Spindle straightness was measured using FIJI by dividing the length of a straight line connecting spindle poles divided by the length of a broken line drawn along the spindle. For spindle rotation, the angle between the initial direction of one spindle pole and its maximal change of direction was measured.\n\nNuclear envelope reassembly\nThe time between nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly was measured based on the first time point where the nuclear envelope is not visible anymore until the time point where the nuclear envelope reappears. Cells from the same embryos are averaged together.\n\nStatistics \nData are plotted using GraphPad Prism. Statistical tests are performed using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10-2. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample that survived the experiment, as assessed by the continuation of cell divisions, was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments. \n"

    "title": "KIF3A tail domain phosphorylation is not required for ciliogenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n",
    "release_date": "2024-02-16",
    "description": "Primary cilia are essential signaling organelles that protrude from most cells in the body. Heterodimeric kinesin-2 (KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3) powers several intracellular transport processes, including intraflagellar transport (IFT), essential for ciliogenesis. A long-standing question is how a motor protein is differentially regulated for specific cargos. Since phosphorylation of the KIF3A tail domain was suggested to regulate the activity of kinesin-2 for ciliogenesis, similarly as for the cytosolic cargo N-Cadherin, we set out to map the phosphosites involved in this regulation. Using well-characterized Kif3a-/-; Kif3b-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we perform ciliogenesis rescue assays with a library of phosphomimetic mutants comprising all predicted phosphosites in the KIF3A tail domain. In contrast to previous reports, we find that KIF3A tail domain phosphorylation is dispensable for ciliogenesis in mammals. Thus, mammalian kinesin-2 is differently regulated for IFT than currently thought, consistent with the idea of differential regulation for ciliary and cytosolic cargo.",

Transfected cells were selected either in the red (KIF3B) channel, if present, or in the green (KIF3A) channel and the presence of a cilium was evaluated in the infrared (ARL13B) channel. Cilium length was manually measured, and only cilia longer than 0.5 \u00b5M were counted as cilia. In the TIF images deposited with this dataset, all cells included in the analysis are non-destructively annotated. In cells with a cilium, the cilium is traced with a numbered line (ROI), and cells without a cilium are marked by a numbered circle."

    "description": "Nix is a membrane-anchored outer mitochondrial protein than induces mitophagy.  While Nix has a LIR motif for binding to ATG8 proteins, it also contains a MER (minimal essential region) that induces mitophagy through an unknown mechanism.  We use chemically induced dimerization (CID) to probe the mechanism of Nix-mediated mitophagy and find that both the LIR and MER are required for robust mitophagy.  We find that the Nix MER interacts with WIPI2 and recruits WIPI2 to mitochondria.  The Nix LIR motif is also required for robust mitophagy and converting WIPI2 coating the mitochondria into puncta, independently of Atg8s. Together this work reveals unanticipated mechanisms in Nix-induced mitophagy and the elusive role of the MER, while also revealing an interesting example of autophagy induction downstream of the Ulk1 initiation and PI3K complexes.",

    "title": "Single-cell profiling and zebrafish avatars reveal LGALS1 as immunomodulating target in glioblastoma",
    "release_date": "2023-06-30",
    "description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival rarely exceeding 2 years. Tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment are key factors contributing to the poor response rates of current therapeutic approaches. GBM-associated macrophages (GAMs) often exhibit immunosuppressive features that promote tumor progression. However, their dynamic interactions with GBM tumor cells remain poorly understood. Here, we used patient-derived GBM stem cell cultures and combined single-cell RNA sequencing of GAM-GBM co-cultures and real-time in vivo monitoring of GAM-GBM interactions in orthotopic zebrafish xenograft models to provide insight into the cellular, molecular, and spatial heterogeneity. Our analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across GBM patients in GBM-induced GAM polarization and the ability to attract and activate GAMs \u2013 features that correlated with patient survival. Differential gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry on original tumor samples, and knock-out experiments in zebrafish subsequently identified LGALS1 as a primary regulator of immunosuppression. Overall, our work highlights that GAM-GBM interactions can be studied in a clinically relevant way using co-cultures and avatar models, while offering new opportunities to identify promising immune-modulating targets.",

Approximately 300-800 cells were injected per embryo and zebrafish avatars were grown at 34\u00b0C until the end of the experiment. At 1 dpi (54 hpf), zebrafish avatars were screened for the presence of GBM cells and those with the largest tumors were selected for overnight imaging. At 5 dpi (144 hpf), the same avatars were imaged again to follow tumor progression. ",

DNA purified from 100K-EVs was enclosed in liposomes using Avalanche-Omni. \n\nFor the MSU-induced arthritis model, C57BL6/J mice were pre-treated with 10 microL of DMSO or 0.25 mg of c-YVAD-cmk- or DMA-dissolved DMSO via the ankle joint injection. Two hours later, 10 microL of PBS or 0.25 mg of MSU crystal\u2013dissolved PBS was injected into each ankle using a 29-gauge needle. Twenty-four hours later, the ankle thickness was measured with precision calipers (Fisherbrand Traceable Digital Calipers; Fisher Scientific), and the tissue of the ankle joint was analyzed histologically by hematoxylin-eosin staining.\n\nFor In vivo experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model,C57BL6/J mice were immunized via s.c. injection with 200 micro-l of emulsion containing 200 micro-g of IRBP1\u201320 in Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (CFA), and 0.2 micro-g of pertussis toxin was added i.p. on the same day (Agarwal et al., 2012). 100K-EVs were administrated via i.v. injection on days 0, 1, 2, and 7 and mice were sacrificed at day 18. After whole eyes were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), sections were cut through the pupillary-optic nerve plane, and H&E staining was performed. \n",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

To automate the measurement of area, a pixel classification model was trained using LabKit (Arzt et al. 2022) by selecting representative foreground and background areas. The imaging data was segmented subsequently with StarDist (WEIGERT et al. 2020) using the above classifier. StarDist automatically classified objects in the images into foreground and background and areas classified as foreground were then measured using the Measure function from the Analyze menu and results were saved. CSV files with all individual morphometric measurements of all specimens were joined into one single table and used for subsequent data analyses."

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. The color balance was adjusted in the camera and in software accordingly. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used. For macroscopic images, the Venus Optics Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter were used. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the photographic objectives or to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30\u00b0/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and a Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth-of-field, images were recorded at different focal planes and by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification).",

Fixation, permeabilization, hybridization and automated fluorescence microscopy imaging were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Molecular preparation of human brain (beta), Molecular coloring, workflow setup) except for a few adaptations indicated below. Briefly, slides were thawed at room temperature and dried at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, the MC observation chamber was assembled by attaching sticky wells (8-well) to the MC slide. Sections were fixed, permeabilized, rehydrated and treated with TrueBlack (Biotium) autofluorescence quencher. In contrast to the MC protocol provided by Resolve Biosciences, we diluted the quencher 1:20 as specified by Biotium. Next, the sections were thoroughly washed and primed before the specific probes against our genes of interest were hybridized at 37\u00b0C overnight. The probe sequences were designed by Resolve Biosciences\u2019 proprietary algorithm and are hence not listed here. After hybridization, the sections were washed, and the MC observation chamber was transferred to the MC machine for eight automated iterations of coloring and imaging to decipher the transcript localization of the 100 different genes of interest in the tissue. Therefore, regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for each section (MB263, MB266, MB295, MB299) based on a brightfield overview scan. In the last imaging round, Nuclei were stained with DAPI yielding a reference image for nuclei segmentation. After the run, the MC software performs registration of the raw images, assigns transcripts to the combinatorial color codes detected and combines individual tiles to ROI panoramas. The outputs are text files containing the transcript coordinates in 3D as well as maximum projections of DAPI images for each ROI. In the images, each pixel has a width and height of 138 nm (x- and y-axis in 2-dimensional space)",

    "description": "3D cell cultures are indispensable in recapitulating in vivo environments. Among the many 3D culture methods, culturing adherent cells on hydrogel beads to form spheroid-like structures is a powerful strategy for maintaining high cell viability and functions in the adherent states. However, high-throughput, scalable technologies for 3D imaging of individual cells cultured on the hydrogel scaffolds are lacking. This study reports the development of a high throughput, scalable 3D imaging flow cytometry platform for analyzing spheroid models. This platform is realized by integrating a single objective fluorescence light-sheet microscopy with a microfluidic device that combines hydrodynamic and acoustofluidic focusing techniques. This integration enabled unprecedentedly high-throughput and scalable optofluidic 3D imaging, processing 1310 spheroids consisting of 28 117 cells per minute. The large dataset obtained enables precise quantification and comparison of the nuclear morphology of adhering and suspended cells, revealing that the adhering cells have smaller nuclei with less rounded surfaces. This platform's high throughput, robustness, and precision for analyzing the morphology of subcellular structures in 3D culture models hold promising potential for various biomedical analyses, including image-based phenotypic screening of drugs with spheroids or organoids.",
