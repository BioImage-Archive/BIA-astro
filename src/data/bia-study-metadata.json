        "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

                        "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                        "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                        "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

        "release_date": "2024-05-17",
        "description": "We present a 3D digital atlas of Cardamine hirsuta ovule development with cellular resolution. The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth (stage 1-I) to the mature pre-fertilization ovule (stage 3-VI). The atlas provides information about the number of cells, their tissue classification, and about characteristics of cellular morphology, such as cell size and shape, for nearly all cells of the ovule. The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

Scan speed was at 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 1 Airy units, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 0.75 and 2. For z-stacks, 12 or 16 bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.33 \u03bcm with voxel size of 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.33 \u03bcm. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

        "release_date": "2024-05-03",
        "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication form between bacteria via small signal molecules that enables global gene regulation as a function of cell density. We applied a microfluidic mother machine to study the kinetics of the QS response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to additions and withdrawals of signal molecules. We traced the fast buildup and the subsequent considerably slower decay of a population-level and single-cell-level QS response. We applied a mathematical model to explain the results quantitatively. We found significant heterogeneity in QS on the single-cell level, which may result from variations in quorum-controlled gene expression and protein degradation. Heterogeneity correlates with cell lineage history, too. We used single-cell data to define and quantitatively characterize the population-level quorum state. We found that the population-level QS response is well-defined. The buildup of the quorum is fast upon signal molecule addition. At the same time, its decay is much slower following signal withdrawal, and the quorum may be maintained for several hours in the absence of the signal.

        "release_date": "2023-04-11",
        "description": "Studies of postmortem human tissue provide insight into pathological processes, but are inherently limited by practical considerations that limit the scale at which tissue can be examined, and the obvious issue that the tissue reflects only one time point in a continuous disease process.  We approached this problem by adapting new tissue clearance techniques to an entire cortical area of human brain, which allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of neurons throughout the depth of the entire cortical thickness.  This approach allows detection of \u201crare\u201d events, that may be difficult to detect in standard 5 micron-thick paraffin sections. For example, it is well established that neurofibrillary tangles begin within a neuron, and ultimately, in at least some instances, persist in the brain even after the neuron has died. These are referred to as \u201cghost tangles\u201d, a term that appropriately implies their \u201cdifficult to see\u201d ephemeral qualities. We set out to find ghost tangles as one example of the power of the tissue clearance/image analysis techniques to detect rare events, and to learn what happens at the end point of a tangle\u2019s life history. We were able to identify 8103 AT8+ tau tangles, 132465 HuD+ neurons, and 299640 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Braak V-VI) and 4 AT8+ tau tangles, 200447 HuD+ neurons, and 462715 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with no significant tau pathology (Braak 0-I).  Among these data we located 57 ghost tangles, which makes them only 0.7% of the total tau tangles observed. We found that ghost tangles are more likely to be found in cortical layers 3 and 5 (49/57), with a select few scattered across other layers 1, 2, 4, and 6. This ability to find rare events, such as ghost tangles, in large enough quantities to statistically test their distribution exemplifies how tissue clearing can be used as a powerful tool for studying selective vulnerability or resilience to pathology across brain regions.",

The staining was then segmented using Ilastik\u2019s pixel classifier workflow. Pixel probability maps and raw data were loaded into Ilastik\u2019s object classification workflow. 1000x1000 pixel regions of each tissue z-stack were cropped and used to train object classifiers. DAPI and Hud object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, single cells, or inseparable clusters of cells. Tau object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, incomplete circle, complete circle, and solid circle shapes. Data was processed as 500x500x20 blocks and applied over the entire image volumes. Data was exported as object identities and spreadsheets with information about the objects\u2019 classification and characteristics, which were then loaded into matlab code to match objects from each channel with colocalized objects."

Tissue was then rinsed 3 times with 50ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes each, then placed in fresh PBS overnight at 4, and rinsed with fresh PBS. Fixed tissue underwent three rinsing cycles in 10-minute increments using 50ml of PBS, then were placed in fresh PBS overnight at 4oC. In preparation for tissue slicing, tissue was transferred to individual 35 mm Petri dishes and embedded in a gel block by pouring warm 4% agarose gel solution in PBS (4g/100ml) (Promega, cat No. V3121) over the tissue. The gel was then cooled to solidify, and cut into a block to provide rigidity for cutting even slices. The tissue was secured on Vibratome (Leica Biosystems, VT1000 S Vibrating Blade Microtome) slide via super gluing the bottom of the agarose block. The vibratome was then used to slice 0.5-1mm thick sections of tissue. Each slice was then removed from the agarose through gentle manipulation with blunt forceps or paintbrushes and were then placed in crosslinking solution, described below.\n\nEach slice was incubated with a hydrogel crosslinking solution containing PBS with 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, ca No. A3553) and 0.25% (wt/vol) VA-044 thermal polymerization initiator (Fisher Scientific, ca No. NC0632395) for 1 day at 4oC to let the molecules diffuse through the tissue. Solutions must be kept cold before and after the addition of VA-044 to prevent premature initiation of polymerization. After incubation with the crosslinking solution for 1 day, the tissue was left in solution and placed in vacuum at 37oC for 3 hours. After polymerization with X-CLARITY polymerization system (Logos Biosystems, South Korea), the slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS three times over 3 hours. \n\nTissue was then placed into Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. L3771) 28.83g/ 500ml PBS clearing solution supplemented with Sodium Borate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. S9640) on shaker at 100 rpm and 37C for approximately 3 days. After delipidation, the brain slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS five times over 24 hours.\n\nEach brain slice was placed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube that could hold the slice so its large, flat sides could be exposed to solution. PBST (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to just cover the top of the samples (~500 \u00b5l). Tissue was heated to 50oC for 1 hour in PBST and then cooled to room temperature prior to incubation with antibodies. The following conjugated antibodies were then added to the solution containing each tissue slice: phospho-tau Ser202, Thr 205 (AT8, 1.6:500, ThermoFisher, cat No. MN1020) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher, cat No. A37573), HuD Antibody E-1 (1.6:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat No. sc-28299) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (ThermoFisher, cat No. A37571), and 4\u2019,6-Diamidine-2\u2019-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1.6:500, Sigma-Aldrich, cat No. 10236276001).

                        "protocol_description": "- Live cell imaging and high speed imaging\nThe live imaging was performed as previously described method. In brief, the organisms were introduced in a rectangular microfluidic chip (length 2.2cm, width 1cm, height 150\u03bcm) of glass slides with copper side walls which act as electrodes. A high speed camera (Phantom V1210 camera, 10000fps) mounted to the microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2, 40X DIC objective) and an electrophysiological DC pulse generator (Grass instruments, S88) were synchronized with a micro-controller (Arduino Uno). Pulse voltage and duration were chosen according to previously reported results.\n\n- Transmission Electron Microscopy\nSpirostomum ambiguum were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PHEM buffer for at least one hour at room temperature. The samples were stained with Safranin-O and stabilized in 1% low melting point agarose, then cut into 1mm cubes. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, room temperature (RT)) in 1X PBS, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 1xPBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, RT) in buffer and then briefly in distilled water. Samples were then subjected to an ascending acetone gradient (10min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%) followed by pure acetone (2\u00d7; 10 min, RT). Samples were progressively infiltrated with Epon resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), while rocking, and then polymerized at 60\u2103 for 24-48 hours in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), collected on glass slides and used for general orientation. Thin sections (70-80 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. Thin sections were\npost-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate, 5 mins each. Then sections were either imaged using a Tecnai 12 120kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) at UC Berkeley, or imaged in the JEOL JEM-1400 120kV with photo taken using a Gatan Orius 2k X 2k digital camera at Stanford University. The montage image was created by SerialEM. All segmentation of organelles was done manually on Fiji.\n\n- Confocal Imaging\nSpirostomum ambiguum were stained alive in 625ng/mL DiOC6(3) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #318426-250MG) and 500nM MitoTracker\u2122 Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #M7510) for 30 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

A high speed camera (Phantom V1210 camera, 10000fps) mounted to the microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2, 40X DIC objective) and an electrophysiological DC pulse generator (Grass instruments, S88) were synchronized with a micro-controller (Arduino Uno). Pulse voltage and duration were chosen according to previously reported results.\n\n- Transmission Electron Microscopy\nSpirostomum ambiguum were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PHEM buffer for at least one hour at room temperature. The samples were stained with Safranin-O and stabilized in 1% low melting point agarose, then cut into 1mm cubes. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, room temperature (RT)) in 1X PBS, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 1xPBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed (3\u00d7; 10 min, RT) in buffer and then briefly in distilled water. Samples were then subjected to an ascending acetone gradient (10min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%) followed by pure acetone (2\u00d7; 10 min, RT). Samples were progressively infiltrated with Epon resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), while rocking, and then polymerized at 60\u2103 for 24-48 hours in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), collected on glass slides and used for general orientation. Thin sections (70-80 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. Thin sections were\npost-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate, 5 mins each. Then sections were either imaged using a Tecnai 12 120kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) at UC Berkeley, or imaged in the JEOL JEM-1400 120kV with photo taken using a Gatan Orius 2k X 2k digital camera at Stanford University. The montage image was created by SerialEM. All segmentation of organelles was done manually on Fiji.\n\n- Confocal Imaging\nSpirostomum ambiguum were stained alive in 625ng/mL DiOC6(3) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #318426-250MG) and 500nM MitoTracker\u2122 Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog #M7510) for 30 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The cells are then fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 30 minutes, and washed in 1X Carter\u2019s media until the supernatant becomes completely transparent and without any yellow-tinged color. The fixed samples are then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen catalog #H3579) in 1:1000 dilution for 15 minutes, followed by washing steps in 1X Carter\u2019s media. The fixed samples are transferred to a glass slide, mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector labs catalog #H-1000), and sealed with #1.5 coverslip. All Chemicals are diluted from stock solution using 1X Carter\u2019s media.\nWe used Bouin\u2019s solution as our fixatives because of its better preservation of soft and delicate structures. However, as the picric acid is a strong oxidizer and may impact the fluorophores, we used a much shorter fixation time, and all the imaging was done within 24 hours after the fixation. The confocal imaging was done on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope, using PLAN APO 63X oil objective (NA 1.4).",

        "description": "Molecular subtyping of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) has been performed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level. However, LUSC stratification based on tissue metabolomics is still lacking. Combining high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry with consensus clustering, four tumor- and four stroma-specific subtypes with distinct metabolite patterns were identified in 330 LUSC patients. The first tumor subtype T1 negatively correlated with DNA damage and immunological features including CD3, CD8, and PD-L1. The same features positively correlated with the tumor subtype T2. Tumor subtype T4 was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Compared with the status of subtypes T1 and T4, patients with subtype T3 had improved prognosis, and T3 was an independent prognostic factor with regard to UICC stage. Similarly, stroma subtypes were linked to distinct immunological features and metabolic pathways. Stroma subtype S4 had a better prognosis than S2. Subsequently, analyses based on an independent LUSC cohort treated by neoadjuvant therapy revealed that the S2 stroma subtype was associated with chemotherapy resistance. Clinically relevant patient subtypes as determined by tissue-based spatial metabolomics are a valuable addition to existing molecular classification systems. Metabolic differences among the subtypes and their associations with immunological features may contribute to the improvement of personalized therapy.",

To image the whole HPF carrier volume and locate single organoids, we first detected cell nuclei marked with Hoechst-33342 and acquired z-stacks with 6x6 tiles of 5122 pixels with 10% overlap, and 10 \u03bcm z-step. The final montage was stitched using ZEN-black software. For single organoids, we acquired z-stacks of 10242 pixels at different z-steps ranging from 1.0 or 1.8 \u03bcm. ",

        "description": "Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta's heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the \u2018Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY\u2019 (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY\u2019s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature.",

        "description": "Recently, a low-level somatic mutation in the NRAS gene (c.182 A > G, Q61R) was identified in various specimens from patients with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis. However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

NRASWT HDLECs showed well-regulated lumen structures and tube formation, but NRASQ61R HDLECs exhibited sheet-like proliferation and the formation of capillary-like structures was markedly less than that of NRASWT HDLECs. The higher the proportion of NRASQ61R HDLECs (fluorescent cells), the greater the sheet-like proliferation and the fewer the capillary-like structures.  2B: In the stepwise examination of NRASQ61R HDLEC mixtures, the covered area (occupied area by cellular components) (a), total nets (number of nets) (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) were analyzed by WinTube.

                            "Metabolome analysis was conducted in accordance with HMT\u2019s C-SCOPE package, using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) for cation analysis and CE-tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) for anion analysis on the basis of the methods described previously (Ohashi et al., 2008; Ooga et al., 2)11,12. Briefly, CE-TOFMS and CE-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent CE capillary electrophoresis system equipped with an Agilent 6210 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Agilent 6460 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (Agilent Technologies), respectively. The systems were controlled by Agilent G2201AA ChemStation software version B.03.01 for CE (Agilent Technologies) and connected by a fused silica capillary (50 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 80 cm total length) with commercial electrophoresis buffer (H3301-1001 and I3302-1023 for cation and anion analyses, respectively, at HMT) as the electrolyte. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 50 to 1,000 (Ohashi et al., 2008)11 and the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to detect compounds in dynamic MRM mode. Peaks were extracted using MasterHands, automatic integration software (Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan) (Sugimoto et al., 2009)13 and MassHunter Quantitative Analysis B.04.00 (Agilent Technologies) to obtain peak information including m/z, peak area and migration time (MT). Signal peaks were annotated in accordance with HMT\u2019s metabolite database based on their m/z values and MTs. The peak area of each metabolite was normalized to internal standards, and metabolite concentration was evaluated by standard curves with three-point calibrations using each standard compound. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis (Yamamoto et al., 2014)14 were performed by HMT\u2019s proprietary MATLAB and R programs, respectively. Detected metabolites were plotted on metabolic pathway maps using VANTED software (Junker et al., 2006)15."

The Lenti-X 293 T cell line was spread on 10-cm plates at a density 5.0 \u00d7 106 cells per plate and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 24 h. The pLVSIN-EF1\u03b1-AcGFP-C1 vector (5.5 \u03bcg) was added to 7 \u03bcL Lentiviral Mix High Titer Packaging Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), 1500 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM, and 45 \u03bcL Trans IT-293 Transfection Reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). After 15 min, this mixture was added to Lenti-X 293 T cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM. After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (this solution contained recombinant lentiviruses). HDLECs were spread onto six-well plates at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The recombinant lentiviral solution was diluted with EBM2 to give solutions with initial concentrations of 1:4 to 1:10. The medium was discarded from each well, and 2 ml of the recombinant lentiviral solutions were added to each well. Polybrene was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. To select stably GFP-only or C-terminal GFP-fused NRASQ61R cells, repeated exchange of the medium and the addition of puromycin (final concentrations of 1.5 \u03bcg/m and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) were performed every 72 h. NRASQ61R expression in these cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GFP gene was transfected into HDLECs by the same method. These transfected cells and NRAS wild type fluorescent cells were used in the scratch assay.",

The Lenti-X 293 T cell line was spread on 10-cm plates at a density 5.0 \u00d7 106 cells per plate and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 24 h. The pLVSIN-EF1\u03b1-AcGFP-C1 vector (5.5 \u03bcg) was added to 7 \u03bcL Lentiviral Mix High Titer Packaging Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), 1500 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM, and 45 \u03bcL Trans IT-293 Transfection Reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). After 15 min, this mixture was added to Lenti-X 293 T cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM. After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (this solution contained recombinant lentiviruses). HDLECs were spread onto six-well plates at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The recombinant lentiviral solution was diluted with EBM2 to give solutions with initial concentrations of 1:4 to 1:10. The medium was discarded from each well, and 2 ml of the recombinant lentiviral solutions were added to each well. Polybrene was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. To select stably GFP-only or C-terminal GFP-fused NRASQ61R cells, repeated exchange of the medium and the addition of puromycin (final concentrations of 1.5 \u03bcg/m and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) were performed every 72 h. NRASQ61R expression in these cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GFP gene was transfected into HDLECs by the same method.
