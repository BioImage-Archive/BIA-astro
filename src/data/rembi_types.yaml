    examples:
    - Two and three days after surgery, sparse labeling of OPCs was achieved by i.p.
      injection of Tamoxifen (Tam; 180mg/kg bodyweight). Imaging fields of view containing
      identified OPCs were selected to obtain 10-20 SPOTs per mouse. Chronic 2-photon
      imaging was performed starting 3 days after surgery. All SPOTs were checked
      on a daily basis and no z-stack was acquired if no changes occurred. The imaging
      was performed on custom-built 2-photon microscope (Sutter Instrument Movable
      Objective Microscope type) using a long-working distance objective (water immersion,
      16x magnification, 0.8NA, Nikon) and equipped with a ytterbium-doped laser system
      at 1045nm and 200fs (Femtotrain, High-Q lasers) or a fiber oscillator 45 laser
      at 1070nm (Fidelity-2, Coherent) to excite tdTomato labeled cells in the CC.
      Emission light was detected using a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu) after passing
      a red emission filter (610/75 nm; AHF).
    - Embryos were imaged on a Luxendo MuVi SPIM light-sheet microscope, using 30x
      magnification setting on the Nikon 10x/0.3 water objective. The 488 nm laser
      was used to image nuclei (His-GFP), and the 561 nm laser was used to image transcriptional
      dots (MCP-mCherry), both at 5% laser power. Exposure time for the green channel
      was 55 ms and exposure for the red channel was 70 ms. The line illumination
      tool was used to improve background levels and was set to 40 pixels.
    - Spherical aberration was minimized using immersion oil with refractive index
      (RI) 1.514. 3D image stacks were acquired over the whole nuclear volume in z
      and with 15 raw images per plane (five phases, three angles). The raw data were
      computationally reconstructed with SoftWoRx 6.5.2 (GE Healthcare) using channel-specific
      OTFs recorded using immersion oil with RI 1.512, and Wiener filter settings
      between 0.002-0.006 to generate 3D stacks of 115 nm (488 nm) or 130 nm (593
      nm) lateral and approximately 350 nm axial resolution. Multi-channel acquisitions
      were aligned in 3D using Chromagnon software (Matsuda et al, 2018) based on
      3D-SIM acquisitions of multi-colour EdU-labelled C127 cells(Kraus et al, 2017).

    examples:
    - Image segmentation was performed for each 2D slice using a program called ilastik,
      which utilizes semantic segmentation. 3D object creation from 2D binary images
      and feature extraction was performed in a program called Arivis.
    - 'Each 3D-SIM image contained one nucleus (in a small number of cases multiple
      nuclei were present, which did not affect the analysis). The image analysis
      pipeline contained six main steps: bivalent skeleton tracing, trace fluorescence
      intensity quantification, HEI10 peak detection, HEI10 foci identification, HEI10
      foci intensity quantification, and total bivalent intensity quantification.
      Note that the normalization steps used for foci identification differ from those
      used for foci intensity quantification; the former was intended to robustly
      identify foci from noisy traces, whilst the latter was used to carefully quantify
      foci HEI10 levels.'
    - "Images were deconvolved using the default conservative deconvolution method\
      \ using DeltaVision Softworx software. Image quantification was carried out\
      \ using Fiji (Schindelin et al, 2012). Deconvolved images were compressed to\
      \ 2D images displaying the maximum intensity projection for each pixel across\
      \ z-stacks listed in Table S7 (column \u201CProjected\u201D). Cell and nuclear\
      \ areas were outlined using thresholding functions on the background TRITC signal\
      \ and DAPI signal, respectively. Dots corresponding to transcripts were then\
      \ counted for both nuclear and cytoplasmic areas for each image by applying\
      \ the \u201CFind Maxima\u201D command with a noise tolerance specified in Table\
      \ S7 (column \u201CMaxima\u201D). Bar charts show the mean number of dots per\
      \ nuclear area and cytoplasmic area across all images for all combined replicates."
