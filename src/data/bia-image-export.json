                    "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                    "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                    "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                    "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

                    "protocol_description": "Immunohistochemistry\nFor postnatal brain samples, animals were first anesthetized and perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) and followed by 4% PFA. Then brains were collected and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight except in the case of Pdgfra immunostaining where fixation for less than 4h is necessary. Fixed brains were first washed with 1x PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose dissolved in 1x PBS till they sank to the bottom. Brain samples were sectioned into 30um slices for immunostaining. For co-staining of Aldh1l1, Pdgfra and GFP, antigens were retrieved in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 65 \u00b0C for 5min to protect Pdgfra and GFP signals. Slices were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 30 min and then incubated in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS) for 1h. After that, slices were incubated in primary antibody solution in 4 \u00b0C overnight. In the following day, slices were first washed with 1x PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature before mounting. \nBrain slice clearing using CUBIC\nTo analyze the morphology of ectopic astrocytes in the neocortex, tissue clearing was performed using CUBIC with slight changes (Susaki et al., 2015). First, after deep anesthetization of mice, cardiac perfusion was performed with 10 ml of 1x PBS and followed with 10 ml of 4% PFA. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Brains were sectioned into 400 to 500 um slices. After washing the slices with 1x PBS for 2h twice at room temperature, the slices were immersed into 1/2-water-diluted reagent1 at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 6-12 h. Then 1/2-water-diluted reagent was replaced with reagent1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2-4 days till slices became transparent in reagent1. Then transparent slices were washed with 1x PBS for 2 h twice at room temperature and immersed in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C till the slices sank into the bottom. After that, slices were washed with 1x PBS three times, 5 min per time slightly. Then slices were incubated in primary antibody solution, diluted in 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 0.5%(w/v) BSA, and 0.1% ProClean 300 in 1x PBS, for 8 days at room temperature. After incubation of the primary antibody, slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 2h twice and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted with the same buffer as primary antibody solution at room temperature for 8 days in the dark. Slices were washed with 5ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in 1x PBS for 3 times, and 2h per time. After washing, slices were immersed in 1/2-PBS-diluted reagent2 and incubated at room temperature overnight. Then 1/2-PBS-diluted reagennt2 was replaced with reagent2 and incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained slices were stocked in reagent2 and images were taken under Nikon confocal microscope mounted in reagent2. \nImaging and 3D reconstruction\nAfter slice cleaning and immunostaining, the slices were carefully mounted on glass slides suing R2 reagent. To prevent deformation of brain slice, small agarose pieces matching the thickness of brain slices were positioned at slide\u2019s four corners prior to placing the coverslip. Imaging was carried out using a confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) equipped with a 25x objective lens. To minimize Z-axis stretching, images were captured with a fine z-step of 0.5um. Subsequently, the captured images underwent denoising via the deep learning method, noise2void, to enhance the visibility of astrocyte processes. Following this denoising process, 3D reconstruction was executed using Imaris software. Briefly, surfaces were created to build the 3D structure of the astrocytes and the territory volume were analyzed. Then these surfaces were employed to mask the fluorescence signal of astrocytes for further filament analysis.  \n",

Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards.

Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards.

Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards.

Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards.

Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards.

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Scan speed was at 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 1 Airy units, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 0.75 and 2. For z-stacks, 12 or 16 bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.33 \u03bcm with voxel size of 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.33 \u03bcm. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

Scan speed was at 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 1 Airy units, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 0.75 and 2. For z-stacks, 12 or 16 bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.33 \u03bcm with voxel size of 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.33 \u03bcm. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

Scan speed was at 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 1 Airy units, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 0.75 and 2. For z-stacks, 12 or 16 bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.33 \u03bcm with voxel size of 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.126 \u03bcm x 0.33 \u03bcm. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. Image acquisition parameters were the following: SR2200 excitation, 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% intensity, detection at 416\u2013476 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. TO-PRO-3 iodide excitation, white-light laser at 642 nm, with a laser power ranging from 2% to 3.5%, detection at 661 to 795 nm, with the gain of the HyD detector set to 400. Images were adjusted for color and contrast using ImageJ (Rueden et al. 2017) or MorphoGraphX software (Strauss et al. 2022).\n",

Tissue was washed in PBS for one minute, transferred again to ClearSee for 20 minutes before mounting in Vectashield antifade agent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). \n",

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",
