Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."

Once at 60\u201380% confluent, cells were dissociated using ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded on 6.5\u2009mm Transwell inserts (Corning) with a 0.4 \u00b5m pore size. Cells were seeded at 3,3 x 10^4 cells/insert and cultured for 2-3 days at liquid-liquid interface in PneumaCult-Ex Plus medium till full confluency was reached. Subsequently, the apical media was removed and the basal media replaced with PneumaCult-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies). The medium was changed every second or third day and the apical surface washed with HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+) once per week from age 25 onwards. The cells were cultured for a minimum of 25 days post airlift before experiments were performed."
