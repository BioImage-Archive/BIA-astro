Initial model training was performed using the initial ground truths and trained on the weak TO-PRO-3 channel. The StarDist-ResNet_3Dnuc_initial model was then used to segment the original weak TO-PRO-3-based nuclear stain channel resulting in a modified ground truth which was then human proofread, resulting in the ‘gold ground truth’.
