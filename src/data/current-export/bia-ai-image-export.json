For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil).

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil). Representative field of views (FOVs) were selected according to the following quality criteria: sharpness, intact nuclei and a sufficient number of nuclei.",

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil). Representative field of views (FOVs) were selected according to the following quality criteria: sharpness, intact nuclei and a sufficient number of nuclei.",

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil).

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil). Representative field of views (FOVs) were selected according to the following quality criteria: sharpness, intact nuclei and a sufficient number of nuclei.",

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil). Representative field of views (FOVs) were selected according to the following quality criteria: sharpness, intact nuclei and a sufficient number of nuclei.",

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil). Representative field of views (FOVs) were selected according to the following quality criteria: sharpness, intact nuclei and a sufficient number of nuclei.",

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil).

For the presented dataset, we digitized the DAPI staining pattern representing nuclear DNA. Additional immunofluorescence or FISH stainings were in part available. An automatic illumination time was set as measured by pixel saturation (Metasystems Metafer and ISIS) or defined manually (Zeiss and Leica LSMs). Objectives used were a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.45; air), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss LSM 780; numerical aperture 0.8; oil), a Zeiss 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat (Leica SP8X; nuermical aperture 0.75; oil), a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II; numerical aperture 0.75) and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7 objective (Zeiss Axioplan II, Zeiss LSM 780 and Leica SP8X; numerical aperture 1.4; oil). Representative field of views (FOVs) were selected according to the following quality criteria: sharpness, intact nuclei and a sufficient number of nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure.

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure.

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist.

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure.

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure.

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist.

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei.",

To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologist\u2019s suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all experts\u2019 suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",

Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration. An inverted widefield microscope, with an objective that has a long working distance, was used for imaging. Up to 4 Ibidi slides were placed into the slide holder in the widefield microscope. The brightfield and all required fluorescence channels, e.g., GFP (excitation at 475 nm & emission 520 nm), and mCherry (excitation at 555 nm & emission at 605 nm) were set up. The positions of all otic vesicles were set with a 20X objective that has a long working distance (minimum 1 mm) and all zebrafish were imaged within the brightfield and fluorescence channels.",

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration. An inverted widefield microscope, with an objective that has a long working distance, was used for imaging. Up to 4 Ibidi slides were placed into the slide holder in the widefield microscope. The brightfield and all required fluorescence channels, e.g., GFP (excitation at 475 nm & emission 520 nm), and mCherry (excitation at 555 nm & emission at 605 nm) were set up. The positions of all otic vesicles were set with a 20X objective that has a long working distance (minimum 1 mm) and all zebrafish were imaged within the brightfield and fluorescence channels.",

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration. An inverted widefield microscope, with an objective that has a long working distance, was used for imaging. Up to 4 Ibidi slides were placed into the slide holder in the widefield microscope. The brightfield and all required fluorescence channels, e.g., GFP (excitation at 475 nm & emission 520 nm), and mCherry (excitation at 555 nm & emission at 605 nm) were set up. The positions of all otic vesicles were set with a 20X objective that has a long working distance (minimum 1 mm) and all zebrafish were imaged within the brightfield and fluorescence channels.",

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Heat 1.5% low-melting point agarose in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube aliquots to 90\u00b0C in a heating block. Once the agarose has melted, reduce the heat to 42\u00b0C.\n2. To increase the number of zebrafish with fluorescently tagged bacteria in the otic vesicle, check fluorescence using any microscope with sufficient sensitivity, magnification, and fluorescence.\n3. Add approximately 9 mL of E3 medium with PTU (final PTU concentration: 0.003%) and10 drops of thawed tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt analytical standard, 4000 mg/L) using a Pasteur pipette (LLG Labware, 3 mL, unsterile) into a small petri dish (Greiner, 60x15mm, sterile). Add this solution into the wells of a 48-well plate, filling 1-2 times the number of wells as treatments.\n4. Move the zebrafish of the first treatment into one or two wells of the 38-well plate, a maximum of five zebrafish per well. \u2192 Careful: try to add as little liquid as possible with\nthe zebrafish into each well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n5. Add 4-5 zebrafish of one treatment into an 8-well Ibidi \u03bc slide (Vitaris). \u2192 Careful: again, try to add as little liquid as possible with the zebrafish into the well to avoid diluting the tricaine concentration.\n6. Using a Pasteur pipette, add about 5 drops of the low-melting point agarose (from the 42\u00b0C in the heating block) to the zebrafish in a well. Note: the more agarose is added, the more time is for positioning the zebrafish.\n7. Using an insect pin tool, mix the agarose and E3 medium from moving the zebrafish well so that the agarose concentration is the same throughout. \u2192 Careful: do not damage the zebrafish with the insect pin.\n8. Position the zebrafish with an insect pin tool so that the injected otic vesicle (see protocol A) is on the bottom of the slide to enable the use of an inverted widefield microscope for imaging. Note: press the zebrafish onto the bottom of the well to reduce the working distance for the microscope, i.e., to improve the quality of the images.\n9. Wait approximately 5 min until the agarose has hardened, then add E3 medium very carefully on top.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for all zebrafish that need to be embedded for imaging.\n11. Add a positive control for each tagged bacterial species/strain, i.e., 10 \u03bcL overnight culture mixed with a drop of agarose into one or half a well.\n\nImage Acquisition:\nTitle:\nImaging instrument:\nLeica Thunder DMi8 widefield microscope with the Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC camera system\nNikon Eclipse Ti2-E with the camera system Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS\nImage acquisition parameters:\nFor imaging, zebrafish were embedded in low-melting-point agarose in an 8-well Ibidi \u00b5-slide, adding water on top for proper hydration.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy of ovules stained with SR2200 and TO-PRO-3 iodide was performed on an upright Leica TCS SP8 X WLL2 HyVolution 2 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with GaAsP (HyD) detectors and a 63\u00d7 glycerol objective (HC PL APO CS2 63\u00d7/1.30 GLYC, CORR CS2). Scan speed was at 400 Hz, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 1 and 2. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. In case of the absence of GaAsP (HyD) detectors laser power and gain have to be adjusted according to the instrument at hand (Additional file 4). SR2200 fluorescence was excited with a 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1 to 1.5% intensity and detected at 420 to 500 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. To-PRO-3 iodide fluorescence excitation was done at 642 nm with the white-light laser with a laser power ranging from 2 to 3.5% and detected at 655 to 720 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 200. Direct Red 23 fluorescence was excited using laser line 561 nm (white-light laser) with the laser power set to 5 to 8% and detected at 580 to 680 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. Calcofluor White fluorescence was excited using the 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with the laser power set to 1 to 3% and detected at 420 to 490 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. For z-stacks 12-bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.24 \u03bcm with optimized system resolution of 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.240 \u03bcm as final pixel size according to the Nyquist criterion. Scan speed was set to 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 0.6 Airy units, line average was between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom was set between 1 and 2, as required. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack.",

Confocal laser scanning microscopy of ovules stained with SR2200 and TO-PRO-3 iodide was performed on an upright Leica TCS SP8 X WLL2 HyVolution 2 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with GaAsP (HyD) detectors and a 63\u00d7 glycerol objective (HC PL APO CS2 63\u00d7/1.30 GLYC, CORR CS2). Scan speed was at 400 Hz, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 1 and 2. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. In case of the absence of GaAsP (HyD) detectors laser power and gain have to be adjusted according to the instrument at hand (Additional file 4). SR2200 fluorescence was excited with a 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1 to 1.5% intensity and detected at 420 to 500 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. To-PRO-3 iodide fluorescence excitation was done at 642 nm with the white-light laser with a laser power ranging from 2 to 3.5% and detected at 655 to 720 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 200. Direct Red 23 fluorescence was excited using laser line 561 nm (white-light laser) with the laser power set to 5 to 8% and detected at 580 to 680 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. Calcofluor White fluorescence was excited using the 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with the laser power set to 1 to 3% and detected at 420 to 490 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. For z-stacks 12-bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.24 \u03bcm with optimized system resolution of 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.240 \u03bcm as final pixel size according to the Nyquist criterion. Scan speed was set to 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 0.6 Airy units, line average was between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom was set between 1 and 2, as required. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack.",

Confocal laser scanning microscopy of ovules stained with SR2200 and TO-PRO-3 iodide was performed on an upright Leica TCS SP8 X WLL2 HyVolution 2 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with GaAsP (HyD) detectors and a 63\u00d7 glycerol objective (HC PL APO CS2 63\u00d7/1.30 GLYC, CORR CS2). Scan speed was at 400 Hz, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 1 and 2. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. In case of the absence of GaAsP (HyD) detectors laser power and gain have to be adjusted according to the instrument at hand (Additional file 4). SR2200 fluorescence was excited with a 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1 to 1.5% intensity and detected at 420 to 500 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. To-PRO-3 iodide fluorescence excitation was done at 642 nm with the white-light laser with a laser power ranging from 2 to 3.5% and detected at 655 to 720 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 200. Direct Red 23 fluorescence was excited using laser line 561 nm (white-light laser) with the laser power set to 5 to 8% and detected at 580 to 680 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. Calcofluor White fluorescence was excited using the 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with the laser power set to 1 to 3% and detected at 420 to 490 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. For z-stacks 12-bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.24 \u03bcm with optimized system resolution of 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.240 \u03bcm as final pixel size according to the Nyquist criterion. Scan speed was set to 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 0.6 Airy units, line average was between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom was set between 1 and 2, as required. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack.",

Confocal laser scanning microscopy of ovules stained with SR2200 and TO-PRO-3 iodide was performed on an upright Leica TCS SP8 X WLL2 HyVolution 2 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with GaAsP (HyD) detectors and a 63\u00d7 glycerol objective (HC PL APO CS2 63\u00d7/1.30 GLYC, CORR CS2). Scan speed was at 400 Hz, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 1 and 2. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. In case of the absence of GaAsP (HyD) detectors laser power and gain have to be adjusted according to the instrument at hand (Additional file 4). SR2200 fluorescence was excited with a 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1 to 1.5% intensity and detected at 420 to 500 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. To-PRO-3 iodide fluorescence excitation was done at 642 nm with the white-light laser with a laser power ranging from 2 to 3.5% and detected at 655 to 720 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 200. Direct Red 23 fluorescence was excited using laser line 561 nm (white-light laser) with the laser power set to 5 to 8% and detected at 580 to 680 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. Calcofluor White fluorescence was excited using the 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with the laser power set to 1 to 3% and detected at 420 to 490 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. For z-stacks 12-bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.24 \u03bcm with optimized system resolution of 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.240 \u03bcm as final pixel size according to the Nyquist criterion. Scan speed was set to 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 0.6 Airy units, line average was between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom was set between 1 and 2, as required. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack.",

Confocal laser scanning microscopy of ovules stained with SR2200 and TO-PRO-3 iodide was performed on an upright Leica TCS SP8 X WLL2 HyVolution 2 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with GaAsP (HyD) detectors and a 63\u00d7 glycerol objective (HC PL APO CS2 63\u00d7/1.30 GLYC, CORR CS2). Scan speed was at 400 Hz, line average between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom between 1 and 2. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack. In case of the absence of GaAsP (HyD) detectors laser power and gain have to be adjusted according to the instrument at hand (Additional file 4). SR2200 fluorescence was excited with a 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with a laser power ranging from 0.1 to 1.5% intensity and detected at 420 to 500 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 20. To-PRO-3 iodide fluorescence excitation was done at 642 nm with the white-light laser with a laser power ranging from 2 to 3.5% and detected at 655 to 720 nm with the gain of the HyD detector set to 200. Direct Red 23 fluorescence was excited using laser line 561 nm (white-light laser) with the laser power set to 5 to 8% and detected at 580 to 680 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. Calcofluor White fluorescence was excited using the 405 nm diode laser (50 mW) with the laser power set to 1 to 3% and detected at 420 to 490 nm with the HyD gain set to 100. For z-stacks 12-bit images were captured at a slice interval of 0.24 \u03bcm with optimized system resolution of 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.063 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.240 \u03bcm as final pixel size according to the Nyquist criterion. Scan speed was set to 400 Hz, the pinhole was set to 0.6 Airy units, line average was between 2 and 4, and the digital zoom was set between 1 and 2, as required. Laser power or gain was adjusted for z compensation to obtain an optimal z-stack.",

It is followed by the ilastik\u2019s multicut workflow (Beier et al., 2017) which takes the boundary segmentation image and produces the cell instance segmentation. These initial segmentation results were iteratively refined (see Appendix 1\u2014figure 1). First, the segmentation is manually proofread in a few selected regions of interest using the open-source Paintera software (Hanslovsky et al., 2019). Second, a state-of-the-art neural network is trained for boundary detection on the manually corrected regions. Third, PlantSeg framework consisting of neural network prediction and image partitioning algorithm is applied to the entire dataset resulting in a more refined segmentation. The 3-step iterative process was repeated until an instance segmentation of satisfactory quality was reached. A final round of manual proofreading with Paintera is performed to finalize the groundtruth.",

It is followed by the ilastik\u2019s multicut workflow (Beier et al., 2017) which takes the boundary segmentation image and produces the cell instance segmentation. These initial segmentation results were iteratively refined (see Appendix 1\u2014figure 1). First, the segmentation is manually proofread in a few selected regions of interest using the open-source Paintera software (Hanslovsky et al., 2019). Second, a state-of-the-art neural network is trained for boundary detection on the manually corrected regions. Third, PlantSeg framework consisting of neural network prediction and image partitioning algorithm is applied to the entire dataset resulting in a more refined segmentation. The 3-step iterative process was repeated until an instance segmentation of satisfactory quality was reached. A final round of manual proofreading with Paintera is performed to finalize the groundtruth.",

It is followed by the ilastik\u2019s multicut workflow (Beier et al., 2017) which takes the boundary segmentation image and produces the cell instance segmentation. These initial segmentation results were iteratively refined (see Appendix 1\u2014figure 1). First, the segmentation is manually proofread in a few selected regions of interest using the open-source Paintera software (Hanslovsky et al., 2019). Second, a state-of-the-art neural network is trained for boundary detection on the manually corrected regions. Third, PlantSeg framework consisting of neural network prediction and image partitioning algorithm is applied to the entire dataset resulting in a more refined segmentation. The 3-step iterative process was repeated until an instance segmentation of satisfactory quality was reached. A final round of manual proofreading with Paintera is performed to finalize the groundtruth.",

Sterilized seeds were germinated on top of 4.5 mm long Blaubrand micropipettes (Cat 708744; 100 \u03bcl) that were immobilised on the bottom of a petri dish and covered with 1/2 MS-phytagel (Maizel et al., 2011). Before sowing, the top of the micropipettes is exposed by removing the phytagel with a razor blade and one seed is sowed per micropipette.

The following settings were used for imaging: image size 2048\u00d72048, exposure time 75 ms, channel #1 illumination 488 nm 10% power, detection 497\u2013553 nm band pass filter, channel #2 illumination 561 nm 10% power, detection 610\u2013628 nm band pass filter. Stacks encompassing the whole volume of the root were acquired every 30 min. Images from the two cameras were fused using the Luxendo Image processing tool and registered to correct any 3D drift using the BigDataProcessor (Tischer et al., 2019) in Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012).",

Sterilized seeds were germinated on top of 4.5 mm long Blaubrand micropipettes (Cat 708744; 100 \u03bcl) that were immobilised on the bottom of a petri dish and covered with 1/2 MS-phytagel (Maizel et al., 2011). Before sowing, the top of the micropipettes is exposed by removing the phytagel with a razor blade and one seed is sowed per micropipette. Plates were stratified for two days and transferred to a growth incubator (23\u00b0C, 16 h day light).",

Stacks encompassing the whole volume of the root were acquired every 30 min. Images from the two cameras were fused using the Luxendo Image processing tool and registered to correct any 3D drift using the BigDataProcessor (Tischer et al., 2019) in Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012).",

Embryos were glued to a coverslip ventral side down and covered with a 1:1 mixture of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

Embryos were glued to a coverslip ventral side down and covered with a 1:1 mixture of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

Embryos were glued to a coverslip ventral side down and covered with a 1:1 mixture of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

Embryos were glued to a coverslip ventral side down and covered with a 1:1 mixture of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

Embryos were glued to a coverslip ventral side down and covered with a 1:1 mixture of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

Embryos were glued to a coverslip ventral side down and covered with a 1:1 mixture of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

To wound the ventral epithelium, cells were irradiated with a pulsed Micropoint N2 laser (Andor, Belfast, UK) tuned to 365 nm, delivering 120 \u03bcJ pulses, 2-6 ns each. 10 consecutive pulses were delivered at discrete points 2 \u03bcm apart along a 12-14 \u03bcm line, targeting 4-5 cell areas. Embryos were imaged with a Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor), using a 60x oil immersion lens (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan; NA 1.35). 16-bit Z-stacks were acquired in 0.50 \u03bcm steps with 11 slices per stack every 30 s (for epidermal cells).

We retained Cellpose's default training parameters: a learning rate of 0.1, weight decay of 0.0001, and 100 epochs. Segmentation was performed with the flow threshold set to 0.4 and nucleus probability threshold set to 0. The nucleus diameter is automatically calculated by Cellpose and set to 173.90 px, i.e. 17.74 \u00b5m.",

We retained Cellpose's default training parameters: a learning rate of 0.1, weight decay of 0.0001, and 100 epochs. Segmentation was performed with the flow threshold set to 0.4 and nucleus probability threshold set to 0. The nucleus diameter is automatically calculated by Cellpose and set to 173.90 px, i.e. 17.74 \u00b5m.",

We retained Cellpose's default training parameters: a learning rate of 0.1, weight decay of 0.0001, and 100 epochs. Segmentation was performed with the flow threshold set to 0.4 and nucleus probability threshold set to 0. The nucleus diameter is automatically calculated by Cellpose and set to 173.90 px, i.e. 17.74 \u00b5m.",

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

For cell synchronisation, cells were incubated with 10 nM RO-3306 (Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit CDK1 activity for 16-18 hours. Unsynchronised cells were seeded using the same protocol and allowed to grow for the same duration.\n\nCell culture for paired fluorescent and brightfield images:\nCells were cultured on an 8-well chambered cover glass (Cellvis) until they reached 60% confluency. They were then fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 minutes and washed three times with PBS. Following this, the samples were incubated with a 0.1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33342 solution for 10 minutes in the dark.",

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods.

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",

For cell synchronisation, cells were incubated with 10 nM RO-3306 (Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit CDK1 activity for 16-18 hours. Unsynchronised cells were seeded using the same protocol and allowed to grow for the same duration.\n\nCell culture for paired fluorescent and brightfield images:\nCells were cultured on an 8-well chambered cover glass (Cellvis) until they reached 60% confluency. They were then fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 minutes and washed three times with PBS. Following this, the samples were incubated with a 0.1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33342 solution for 10 minutes in the dark.",

Exposure times were adjusted based on the experimental conditions for different fields of view within the same well (100 ms for 0.6 J/cm^2, 1 s for 6 J/cm^2, and 10 s for 60 J/cm^2). The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

Exposure times were adjusted based on the experimental conditions for different fields of view within the same well (100 ms for 0.6 J/cm^2, 1 s for 6 J/cm^2, and 10 s for 60 J/cm^2). The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods.

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

Unsynchronised cells were seeded using the same protocol and allowed to grow for the same duration.\n\nCell culture for paired fluorescent and brightfield images:\nCells were cultured on an 8-well chambered cover glass (Cellvis) until they reached 60% confluency. They were then fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 minutes and washed three times with PBS. Following this, the samples were incubated with a 0.1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33342 solution for 10 minutes in the dark.",

The power used for each wavelength line was as follows: 84.9 \u00b1 2.8 mW for 385 nm, 85.2 \u00b1 0.8 mW for 475 nm, and 70.6 \u00b1 0.4 mW for 630 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n\nImages were taken every 4 minutes for a duration of 8 hours, with a pixel size of 0.55 \u00b5m x 0.55 \u00b5m. Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode. Brightfield images were captured alongside fluorescent images using the 385 nm filter to obtain paired brightfield and Hoechst-stained images.",

Temperature and CO2 levels were consistently maintained at 37\u00baC and 5%, respectively, throughout the exposure to excitation light and imaging periods. For fixed samples, cells were imaged using the same objective lens in multichannel acquisition mode.

The image collection was organized to include different technical settings and a variety of biologically different experiments.

The dataset also included tissue samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin, displaying structures from a diversity of organs and animal models. The image collection was organized to include different technical settings and a variety of biologically different experiments. We excluded phase-contrast, differential interference contrast and other image modalities because during the data collection period we did not find image sets or donating laboratories that could make these images available in the public domain.",

The dataset also included tissue samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin, displaying structures from a diversity of organs and animal models. The image collection was organized to include different technical settings and a variety of biologically different experiments. We excluded phase-contrast, differential interference contrast and other image modalities because during the data collection period we did not find image sets or donating laboratories that could make these images available in the public domain.",

The dataset also included tissue samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin, displaying structures from a diversity of organs and animal models. The image collection was organized to include different technical settings and a variety of biologically different experiments. We excluded phase-contrast, differential interference contrast and other image modalities because during the data collection period we did not find image sets or donating laboratories that could make these images available in the public domain.",

The dataset also included tissue samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin, displaying structures from a diversity of organs and animal models. The image collection was organized to include different technical settings and a variety of biologically different experiments. We excluded phase-contrast, differential interference contrast and other image modalities because during the data collection period we did not find image sets or donating laboratories that could make these images available in the public domain.",
