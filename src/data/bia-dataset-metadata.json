      "description": "Mitophagy is a form of selective autophagy that disposes of superfluous and potentially damage-inducing organelles in a tightly controlled manner. While the machinery involved in mitophagy induction is well known, the regulation of the components is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that TNIP1 knock out accelerates mitophagy rates, and that ectopic TNIP1 negatively regulates the rate of mitophagy. These functions of TNIP1 depend on an evolutionarily conserved LIR motif as well as an AHD3 domain, which are required for binding to the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins and the autophagy receptor TAX1BP1, respectively. We further show that phosphorylation appears to regulate its association with the ULK1 complex member FIP200, allowing TNIP1 to compete with autophagy receptors, providing a molecular rationale for its inhibitory function during mitophagy. Taken together, our findings identify a novel negative regulator of mitophagy that acts at the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis. ",

      "description": "Bacteria encounter polymeric nutrient sources that need to be processed to support growth. Bacillus subtilis is a bacterium known for its adaptability and resilience within the rhizosphere and broader soil environment. Here we explore the role that a suite of extracellular proteases plays in supporting growth of B. subtilis when an extracellular heterologous protein (BSA) provides an abundant, but polymeric, food source. We confirm the essential role of extracellular proteases in this context and note the influence of the polymeric nutrient concentration on the yield of growth, but not on the relative level of extracellular proteases. We demonstrate the collective action of the extracellular proteases in supporting B. subtilis growth and evidence their use as a shared public good. Furthermore, we show that B. subtilis is subjected to a public good dilemma, but only in the context of using a polymeric food source. Using mathematical simulations, we uncover that this dilemma is driven by the relative cost of producing the public good. Collectively, our findings reveal how B. subtilis can survive in environments that vary significantly in terms of immediate nutrient accessibility. This information should inform steps to improve its efficacy as a biofertilizer in agricultural settings.",

      "title": "A PDLP-NHL3 complex integrates plasmodesmal immune signaling cascades",
      "release_date": "2023-03-01",
      "description": "The plant immune system relies on the perception of molecules that signal the presence of a microbe threat. This triggers signal transduction that mediates a range of cellular responses via a collection of molecular machinery including receptors, small molecules, and enzymes. One response to pathogen perception is the restriction of cell-to-cell communication by plasmodesmal closure. We previously found that while chitin and flg22 trigger specialized immune signaling cascades in the plasmodesmal plasma membrane, both execute plasmodesmal closure via callose synthesis at the plasmodesmata. This indicates the signaling pathways ultimately converge at or upstream of callose synthesis. To establish the hierarchy of signaling at plasmodesmata and characterize points of convergence in microbe elicitor-triggered signaling, we profiled the dependence of plasmodesmal responses triggered by different elicitors on a range of plasmodesmal signaling machinery. We identified that, like chitin, flg22 signals via RBOHD to induce plasmodesmal closure. Further, we found that PDLP1, PDLP5 and CALS1 are common to microbe- and SA-triggered responses, identifying PDLPs as a candidate signaling nexus. To understand how PDLPs relay a signal to CALS1, we screened for PDLP5 interactors and found NHL3, which is also required for chitin-, flg22- and SA-triggered plasmodesmal responses and PDLP-mediated activation of callose synthesis. We conclude that a PDLP-NHL3 complex acts as an integrating node of plasmodesmal signaling cascades, transmitting multiple immune signals to activate CALS1 and plasmodesmata closure.",

      "release_date": "2023-04-21",
      "description": "Preventing parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes is recognised to be critical for achieving elimination and eradication of malaria. Consequently developing new antimalarial drugs with transmission-blocking properties is a priority. Large screening campaigns have identified many new transmission-blocking molecules, however little is known about how they target transmissible Plasmodium falciparum stage V gametocytes, or how they affect their underlying cell biology. To respond to this knowledge gap, we have developed a machine learning image analysis pipeline to characterise and compare the cellular phenotypes generated by transmission-blocking molecules during male gametogenesis.

      "release_date": "2023-04-21",
      "description": "Preventing parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes is recognised to be critical for achieving elimination and eradication of malaria. Consequently developing new antimalarial drugs with transmission-blocking properties is a priority. Large screening campaigns have identified many new transmission-blocking molecules, however little is known about how they target transmissible Plasmodium falciparum stage V gametocytes, or how they affect their underlying cell biology. To respond to this knowledge gap, we have developed a machine learning image analysis pipeline to characterise and compare the cellular phenotypes generated by transmission-blocking molecules during male gametogenesis. Using this approach, we studied 40 molecules, categorising their activity based upon timing of action and visual effects on the organisation of tubulin and DNA in the cell. Our data both proposes new modes of action and corroborates existing modes of action of identified transmission-blocking molecules. Furthermore, the characterised molecules provide a new armoury of tool compounds to probe gametocyte cell biology and the generated imaging dataset provides a new reference for researchers to correlate molecular target or gene deletion to specific cellular phenotype. Our analysis pipeline is not optimised for a specific organism and could be applied to any fluorescence microscopy dataset containing cells delineated by bounding boxes, and so is extendible to any disease model.",

Z-stack images with 0.3\u00b5m slices were captured for each field of view and images deconvolved and transformed by maximum intensity projection within the Nikon NIS Elements software. All images were background corrected using an automated processing pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis. To do this, a region of interest (ROI) containing no cells was manually drawn on all images and then the pipeline subtracted the mean fluorescence of the ROI in each fluorescence channel from the image. Afterwards, cells were initially identified by an automated analysis pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis based upon the intensity of the tubulin staining captured which assigns a region of interest (ROI) around each cell. All ROIs were reviewed by a trained operator and adjusted if necessary to reflect the true outline of the cell (for example if two cells touching had been allocated the same ROI).\nAll images with identified cells were then analysed as complete datasets within our developed PhIDDLI analysis pipeline which uses machine learning to cluster individual cells by phenotype and visualise the result either in tabulated form or an interactive tSNE plot.\n"

Z-stack images with 0.3\u00b5m slices were captured for each field of view and images deconvolved and transformed by maximum intensity projection within the Nikon NIS Elements software. All images were background corrected using an automated processing pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis. To do this, a region of interest (ROI) containing no cells was manually drawn on all images and then the pipeline subtracted the mean fluorescence of the ROI in each fluorescence channel from the image. Afterwards, cells were initially identified by an automated analysis pipeline developed in ICY Bioimage Analysis based upon the intensity of the tubulin staining captured which assigns a region of interest (ROI) around each cell. All ROIs were reviewed by a trained operator and adjusted if necessary to reflect the true outline of the cell (for example if two cells touching had been allocated the same ROI).\nAll images with identified cells were then analysed as complete datasets within our developed PhIDDLI analysis pipeline which uses machine learning to cluster individual cells by phenotype and visualise the result either in tabulated form or an interactive tSNE plot.\n"

Nevertheless, axonal regeneration is greatly impaired in aged organisms or after chronic denervation leading to important clinical problems. This regenerative failure has been associated to a diminished c-Jun expression by Schwann cells, but whether the inability of these cells to maintain a repair state is associated to the transition into a phenotype inhibitory for axonal growth, has not been evaluated so far. We find that repair Schwann cells transitions into a senescent phenotype, characterized by diminished c-Jun expression and secretion of factor inhibitory for axonal regeneration in both aging and chronic denervation. In both conditions, elimination of senescent Schwann cells by systemic senolytic drug treatment or genetic targeting improves nerve regeneration and functional recovery in aging and chronic denervation, associated with an upregulation of c-Jun expression and a decrease in nerve inflammation. This work provides the first characterization of senescent Schwann cells and their impact over axonal regeneration in aging and chronic denervation, opening new avenues for enhancing regeneration, and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries.

      "release_date": "2023-03-21",
      "description": "Significance: CSF rhinorrhea (leakage of brain fluid from the nose) can be difficult to identify and currently requires invasive procedures such as intrathecal fluorescein which requires a lumbar drain placement. Fluorescein is also known to have rare but significant side effects including seizures and death. As the number of endonasal skull base cases increase, the number of CSF leaks have also increased for which an alternative diagnostic method would be highly advantageous to patients.\nAim:  To develop an instrument to identify CSF leaks based on water absorption in the SWIR without the need of intrathecal contrast agents. This device needed to be adapted to the anatomy of the human nasal cavity while maintaining low weight and ergonomic characteristics of current surgical instruments.\nApproach: Absorption spectra of CSF and artificial CSF were obtained to characterize the absorption peaks that could be targeted with SWIR light. Different illumination systems were tested and refined prior to adapting them into a portable endoscope for testing in 3D printed models and cadavers for feasibility. \nResults: We identified CSF to have an identical absorption profile as water. In our testing, a narrow band laser source at 1480nm proved superior to using a broad 1450 nm LED. Using a SWIR enabling endoscope set up, we tested the ability to detect artificial CSF in a cadaver model.\nConclusions: An endoscopic system based on SWIR narrow band imaging can provide an alternative in the future to invasive methods of CSF leak detection.",

      "description": "FAM3C/ILEI is an important cytokine for tumor progression and metastasis. However, its involvement in inflammation remains elusive. Here, we show that ILEI protein is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions. Inducible keratinocyte-specific ILEI overexpression in mice (K5-ILEIind) recapitulates many aspects of psoriasis following TPA challenge, primarily manifested by impaired epidermal differentiation and increased neutrophil recruitment. Mechanistically, ILEI triggers Erk and Akt signaling, which then activate STAT3 via Ser727 phosphorylation. Keratinocyte-specific ILEI deletion ameliorates TPA-induced skin inflammation. A transcriptomic ILEI signature obtained from the K5-ILEIind model shows enrichment in several signaling pathways also found in psoriasis and identifies urokinase as a targetable enzyme to counteract ILEI activity. Pharmacological inhibition of urokinase in TPA-induced K5-ILEIind mice results in significant improvement of psoriasiform symptoms by reducing ILEI secretion. The ILEI signature distinguishes psoriasis from healthy skin with uPA ranking among the top \u201cseparator\u201d genes. Our study identifies ILEI as a key driver in psoriasis, indicates the relevance of ILEI-regulated genes for disease manifestation and shows the clinical impact of ILEI and urokinase as novel potential therapeutic targets in psoriasis.",

      "release_date": "2023-04-03",
      "description": "The neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis impacts over 700 million people globally. Schistosoma mansoni, the trematode parasite that causes the most common type of schistosomiasis, requires planorbid pond snails of the genus Biomphalaria to support its larval development and transformation to the cercarial form that can infect humans.  A greater understanding of neural signaling systems that are specific to the Biomphalaria intermediate host could lead to novel strategies for parasite or snail control.  This study examined a Biomphalaria glabrata neural channel that is gated by the neuropeptide FMRF-NH2. The Biomphalaria glabrata FMRF-NH2 gated sodium channel (Bgl-FaNaC) amino acid sequence was highly conserved with FaNaCs found in related gastropods, especially the planorbid Planorbella trivolvis (91% sequence identity). In common with the P. trivolvis FaNaC, the B. glabrata channel exhibited a low affinity (EC50: 3 x 10-4 M) and high specificity for the FMRF-NH2 agonist. Its expression in the central nervous system, detected with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, was widespread, with the protein localized mainly to neuronal fibers and the mRNA confined to cell bodies. Colocalization of the Bgl-FaNaC message with its FMRF-NH2 agonist precursor occurred in some neurons associated with male mating behavior.  At the mRNA level, Bgl-FaNaC expression was decreased at 20 and 35 days post infection (dpi) by S. mansoni.  Increased expression of the transcript encoding the FMRF-NH2 agonist at 35 dpi was proposed to reflect a compensatory response to decreased receptor levels. Altered FMRF-NH2 signaling could be vital for parasite proliferation in its intermediate host and may therefore present innovative opportunities for snail control. ",

    "description": "The STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of seven transcription factors in mammals, namely STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. These proteins are the substrate of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Janus kinases (JAK), which catalyse their phosphorylation of a single C-terminal tyrosine residue after ligand binding to cell surface receptors. About 50 different growth factors and cytokines including interferons, interleukins and growth hormones are known to signal via STAT proteins. The activated STATs accumulate in the nucleus and participate in the transcription of hundreds of genes. This sequence of events, usually referred to as canonical JAK-STAT signalling, entails the dimerization of STAT proteins through mutual phosphotyrosine:SH2 domain interactions. Such dimers can bind short palindromic stretches of DNA called GAS elements in the promoter region of target genes. In addition to homodimers, activated STATs can assemble heterodimers with the other family members. While the phosphotyrosine-mediated functions of STATs were linked to their dimerization early on, much less is known to date regarding the constitutive self-assembly of latent, that is unphosphorylated STATs (U-STATs). Initially, U-STATs were believed to be monomeric, but further studies showed that STATs can assemble high molecular weight complexes already before tyrosine phosphorylation. A well-documented example is STAT1, which forms equally strong dimers before and after activation as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, crystallographic evidence demonstrates that unphosphorylated dimers of STAT1; STAT3 and STAT5 are stabilized not by interactions of the carboxy-terminal SH2 domains, but by interactions between amino terminal regions, resulting in antiparallel orientation of monomers as opposed to their parallel orientation in the phosphodimers. It has been recognized that unphosphorylated STATs are involved in many biological events in both normal and pathological situations. In some instances, the self-assembly of U-STAT has been linked to tyrosine phosphorylation and cytokine signalling. For example, the homodimerization of U-STAT4 is a prerequisite for cytokine-induced STAT4 activation, and heterodimerization of U-STAT1 with U-STAT2 has been shown to have positive or negative consequences for type 1 and type 2 interferon signalling, respectively. These and other findings indicate that U-STAT dimers fulfil roles critical for cytokine functioning, but the knowledge of dimerization before cytokine-induced phosphorylation remains incomplete. This is particularly true for heterotypic interactions across the STAT family and the in-vivo situation generally. To fill in knowledge gaps, we devised an assay to explore systematically the repertoires of homo- and heterotypic interactions among U-STATs in living cells. The assay is based on U-STATs being nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that can freely cross the soft diffusion barrier posed by the nuclear pore, presumably via direct contacts with nuclear pore proteins. It results in generally pancellular distributions of U-STATs, which for STAT1 and STAT2 can be shifted to nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation by tagging them with transferable carrier-dependent nuclear localisation (NLS) or nuclear export (NES) signals. We reasoned that tagged variants thus could function as baits that attract co-expressed test proteins if binding interactions occurred. This would be evident by their co-localization in the bait protein\u2019s compartment. After rigorous testing and verification, this approach was used to probe homo-and heterotypic binding interactions within cells across the entire STAT family for the first time. ",

All pixel values were measured below saturation limits.\n\nThe assay scores the extent of co-localisation of a cytoplasmic or nuclear accumulated STAT protein (STAT-NES or STAT-NLS), which functions as the bait, with another STAT, the test protein, whereby the two proteins are fused to different fluorophores. We used mCherry and mEGFP, as they are monomeric, and their emission spectra display minimal overlap. Co-localisation is taken as a proxy for the degree of dimerization via homo- or heterotypic interactions. In the basic assay configuration, wild-type STAT proteins were tested. To assess dimer conformation, we tested single point mutants homologous to key interacting residues of STAT1 (F77 or L78), which are critical for the assembly of antiparallel dimers of the unphosphorylated protein. To assess dimer stability, bait and test proteins were furnished with opposed translocation signals (STAT-NES co-expressed with STAT-NLS) to provide forces that counteract the association of the two protomers in STAT dimers. For all assay configurations, knowledge of the relative cellular expression levels of the two co-expressed STAT proteins is necessary to ensure bait proteins are present in excess. As the STATs were expressed as fusions with mEGFP or mCherry, information about their relative expression levels could be obtained by comparison with a mEGFP-mCherry fusion protein, which expressed mEGFP and mCherry fluorophores in a known and fixed ratio of one-to-one. To facilitate quantification of the co-localisation assay, all images were acquired using exposure times calibrated such that the mEGFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities were approximately equal. We found that this acquisition setting reproducibly gave equivalent readings even when used on different days. Using these setting, cells were imaged, and single cells were manually segmented in ImageJ. Cells were eligible for quantitative co-localization analyses if the bait STAT protein was present from equimolar amounts to up to 4-fold molar excess compared to the co-expressed test variant. To obtain quantitative estimates of the degree of co-localization in the images, Pearson (rP) and Spearman (rS, given in the source data files) correlation coefficients were calculated for individual cells with the PSC co-localization ImageJ plug-in as described. Both tests produce values in the range [\u22121, 1], 0 indicating that there is no discernible correlation and \u22121 and +1 meaning strong negative and positive correlations, respectively. Cells where fewer than 1000 pixels had intensity values above that which might be considered image noise for at least one of the channels at that data point were also deemed ineligible and excluded from further calculations. The PSC programme\u2019s default intensity setting of 40 was used as the image noise threshold. Values for Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for 10-30 eligible cells per experiment and are given as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). "

      "description": "The conversion of STAT proteins from latent to active transcription factors is central to cytokine signalling. Triggered by their signal-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, it is the assembly of a range of cytokine-specific STAT homo- and heterodimers that marks a key step in the transition of hitherto latent proteins to transcription activators. In contrast, the constitutive self-assembly of latent STATs and how it relates to the functioning of activated STATs, is understood less well. To provide a more complete picture, we developed a co-localisation-based assay and tested all 28 possible combinations of the seven unphosphorylated STAT proteins in living cells. It led to the identification of five U-STAT homodimers \u2015STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A and STAT5B\u2015 and two heterodimers \u2015STAT1:STAT2 and STAT5A:STAT5B\u2015 as well as semi-quantitative assessments of the forces and characterisations of binding interfaces that support them. One STAT protein \u2015STAT6\u2015 was found to be monomeric. This comprehensive analysis of latent STAT self-assembly lays bare considerable structural and functional diversity in the ways that link STAT dimerization before and after activation.",

      "description": "Fluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a key method for observing protein distribution, dynamics, and interaction with other proteins in living cells. However, the typical approach using overexpression of tagged proteins can perturb cell behavior and introduce localization artifacts. To preserve native expression, fluorescent proteins can be inserted directly into endogenous genes. This approach has been widely used in yeast for decades, and more recently in invertebrate model organisms with the advent of CRISPR/Cas9. However, endogenous FP tagging has not been widely used in mammalian cells due to inefficient homology-directed repair. Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

      "description": "Fluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a key method for observing protein distribution, dynamics, and interaction with other proteins in living cells. However, the typical approach using overexpression of tagged proteins can perturb cell behavior and introduce localization artifacts. To preserve native expression, fluorescent proteins can be inserted directly into endogenous genes. This approach has been widely used in yeast for decades, and more recently in invertebrate model organisms with the advent of CRISPR/Cas9. However, endogenous FP tagging has not been widely used in mammalian cells due to inefficient homology-directed repair. Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

      "description": "Fluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a key method for observing protein distribution, dynamics, and interaction with other proteins in living cells. However, the typical approach using overexpression of tagged proteins can perturb cell behavior and introduce localization artifacts. To preserve native expression, fluorescent proteins can be inserted directly into endogenous genes. This approach has been widely used in yeast for decades, and more recently in invertebrate model organisms with the advent of CRISPR/Cas9. However, endogenous FP tagging has not been widely used in mammalian cells due to inefficient homology-directed repair. Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

      "description": "Fluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a key method for observing protein distribution, dynamics, and interaction with other proteins in living cells. However, the typical approach using overexpression of tagged proteins can perturb cell behavior and introduce localization artifacts. To preserve native expression, fluorescent proteins can be inserted directly into endogenous genes. This approach has been widely used in yeast for decades, and more recently in invertebrate model organisms with the advent of CRISPR/Cas9. However, endogenous FP tagging has not been widely used in mammalian cells due to inefficient homology-directed repair. Recently, the CRISPaint system has utilized non-homologous end joining for efficient integration of FP tags into native loci, but it only allows C-terminal knock-ins. Here, we enhanced the CRISPaint system by introducing new universal donors for N-terminal insertion and for multicolor tagging with orthogonal selection markers. We adapted the procedure for mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be differentiated into diverse cell types. Our protocol is rapid and efficient, enabling live imaging in less than 2 weeks post-transfection. These improvements increase the versatility and applicability of FP knock-in in mammalian cells.",

To validate the quality of the SMLM reconstructions by quantitative error mapping of super-resolution images we used the NanoJ-SQUIRREL package (Culley et al., 2018; Schindelin et al., 2012) in FIJI. For Fourier ring correlation (FRC) analysis, 20 000 images from the time series were split into odd and even frames, which were used to reconstruct super-resolution images in ThunderSTORM. Images were then merged into a stack in FIJI and used as the input for the FRC analysis in NanoJ-SQUIRREL. Density-based cluster analysis was performed in the SMAP environment (Ries, 2020). For the clustering analysis, the super-resolution reconstructions were first processed by the density calculator (counting neighbours for each localization in a circle < 12 nm), which was then used to filter out localizations in lowest-density regions. Subsequently, we calculated the number of clusters using DBscan, using the SMAP implementation of the algorithm by Caetano et al., 2015; with the minimum number of objects in the neighbourhood set to 7; the neighbouring radius set to 20. 3D surface projections were rendered using the Imaris software (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments)."

      "description": "Hepatocytes form bile canaliculi that dynamically respond to the signalling activity of bile acids and bile flow. Little is known about their responses to intraluminal pressure. During embryonic development, hepatocytes assemble apical bulkheads that increase the canalicular resistance to intraluminal pressure. Here, we investigated if they may also protect bile canaliculi against elevated pressure upon impaired bile flow in adult liver. Apical bulkheads accumulate upon bile flow obstruction in mouse models and patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Their loss under these conditions leads to abnormally dilated canaliculi, resembling liver cell rosettes described in other hepatic diseases. 3D reconstruction revealed that these structures are sections of cysts and tubes formed by hepatocytes. Mathematical modelling established that they positively correlate with canalicular pressure and occur early in PSC. Using primary hepatocytes and 3D organoids, we demonstrated that excessive canalicular pressure causes the loss of apical bulkheads and formation of rosettes. Our results suggest that apical bulkheads are a protective mechanism of hepatocytes against impaired bile flow, highlighting the role of canalicular pressure in liver diseases.",

A segmented line is used to define the size and the location of the LifeAct or Myh9-GFP cap. Starting at the first division timepoint the intensity is measured at the segmented line, with the length of the eventually formed cap, and the distance between the center of the DNA mass and the center of the segmented line. The intensity of another segmented line drawn with the same length on a different part of the cell-medium interface where no cortical fluctuations are observed is used to normalize the intensity. \n\nSpindle analysis\nSpindle persistence was calculated by measuring the time between the appearance and disappearance of the spindle. Spindle straightness was measured using FIJI by dividing the length of a straight line connecting spindle poles divided by the length of a broken line drawn along the spindle. For spindle rotation, the angle between the initial direction of one spindle pole and its maximal change of direction was measured.\n\nNuclear envelope reassembly\nThe time between nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly was measured based on the first time point where the nuclear envelope is not visible anymore until the time point where the nuclear envelope reappears. Cells from the same embryos are averaged together.\n\nStatistics \nData are plotted using GraphPad Prism. Statistical tests are performed using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10-2. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample that survived the experiment, as assessed by the continuation of cell divisions, was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments. \n"

      "description": "Cell fragmentation is commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and is associated with poor prognosis during assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. However, the mechanisms leading to cell fragmentation remain largely unknown. Here, light sheet microscopy imaging of mouse embryos reveals that inefficient chromosome separation due to spindle defects, caused by dysfunctional molecular motors Myo1c or dynein, leads to fragmentation during mitosis. Extended exposure of the cell cortex to chromosomes locally triggers actomyosin contractility and pinches off cell fragments. This process is reminiscent of meiosis, during which small GTPase-mediated signals from chromosomes coordinate polar body extrusion (PBE) by actomyosin contraction. By interfering with the signals driving PBE, we find that this meiotic signaling pathway remains active during cleavage stages and is both required and sufficient to trigger fragmentation. Together, we find that fragmentation happens in mitosis after ectopic activation of actomyosin contractility by signals emanating from DNA, similar to those observed during meiosis. Our study uncovers the mechanisms underlying fragmentation in preimplantation embryos and, more generally, offers insight into the regulation of mitosis during the maternal-zygotic transition.",

Transfected cells were selected either in the red (KIF3B) channel, if present, or in the green (KIF3A) channel and the presence of a cilium was evaluated in the infrared (ARL13B) channel. Cilium length was manually measured, and only cilia longer than 0.5 \u00b5M were counted as cilia. In the TIF images deposited with this dataset, all cells included in the analysis are non-destructively annotated. In cells with a cilium, the cilium is traced with a numbered line (ROI), and cells without a cilium are marked by a numbered circle."

      "description": "Primary cilia are essential signaling organelles that protrude from most cells in the body. Heterodimeric kinesin-2 (KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3) powers several intracellular transport processes, including intraflagellar transport (IFT), essential for ciliogenesis. A long-standing question is how a motor protein is differentially regulated for specific cargos. Since phosphorylation of the KIF3A tail domain was suggested to regulate the activity of kinesin-2 for ciliogenesis, similarly as for the cytosolic cargo N-Cadherin, we set out to map the phosphosites involved in this regulation. Using well-characterized Kif3a-/-; Kif3b-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we perform ciliogenesis rescue assays with a library of phosphomimetic mutants comprising all predicted phosphosites in the KIF3A tail domain. In contrast to previous reports, we find that KIF3A tail domain phosphorylation is dispensable for ciliogenesis in mammals. Thus, mammalian kinesin-2 is differently regulated for IFT than currently thought, consistent with the idea of differential regulation for ciliary and cytosolic cargo.",

      "description": "Nix is a membrane-anchored outer mitochondrial protein than induces mitophagy.  While Nix has a LIR motif for binding to ATG8 proteins, it also contains a MER (minimal essential region) that induces mitophagy through an unknown mechanism.  We use chemically induced dimerization (CID) to probe the mechanism of Nix-mediated mitophagy and find that both the LIR and MER are required for robust mitophagy.  We find that the Nix MER interacts with WIPI2 and recruits WIPI2 to mitochondria.  The Nix LIR motif is also required for robust mitophagy and converting WIPI2 coating the mitochondria into puncta, independently of Atg8s. Together this work reveals unanticipated mechanisms in Nix-induced mitophagy and the elusive role of the MER, while also revealing an interesting example of autophagy induction downstream of the Ulk1 initiation and PI3K complexes.",

      "description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival rarely exceeding 2 years. Tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment are key factors contributing to the poor response rates of current therapeutic approaches. GBM-associated macrophages (GAMs) often exhibit immunosuppressive features that promote tumor progression. However, their dynamic interactions with GBM tumor cells remain poorly understood. Here, we used patient-derived GBM stem cell cultures and combined single-cell RNA sequencing of GAM-GBM co-cultures and real-time in vivo monitoring of GAM-GBM interactions in orthotopic zebrafish xenograft models to provide insight into the cellular, molecular, and spatial heterogeneity. Our analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across GBM patients in GBM-induced GAM polarization and the ability to attract and activate GAMs \u2013 features that correlated with patient survival. Differential gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry on original tumor samples, and knock-out experiments in zebrafish subsequently identified LGALS1 as a primary regulator of immunosuppression. Overall, our work highlights that GAM-GBM interactions can be studied in a clinically relevant way using co-cultures and avatar models, while offering new opportunities to identify promising immune-modulating targets.",

      "description": "3D cell cultures are indispensable in recapitulating in vivo environments. Among the many 3D culture methods, culturing adherent cells on hydrogel beads to form spheroid-like structures is a powerful strategy for maintaining high cell viability and functions in the adherent states. However, high-throughput, scalable technologies for 3D imaging of individual cells cultured on the hydrogel scaffolds are lacking. This study reports the development of a high throughput, scalable 3D imaging flow cytometry platform for analyzing spheroid models. This platform is realized by integrating a single objective fluorescence light-sheet microscopy with a microfluidic device that combines hydrodynamic and acoustofluidic focusing techniques. This integration enabled unprecedentedly high-throughput and scalable optofluidic 3D imaging, processing 1310 spheroids consisting of 28 117 cells per minute. The large dataset obtained enables precise quantification and comparison of the nuclear morphology of adhering and suspended cells, revealing that the adhering cells have smaller nuclei with less rounded surfaces. This platform's high throughput, robustness, and precision for analyzing the morphology of subcellular structures in 3D culture models hold promising potential for various biomedical analyses, including image-based phenotypic screening of drugs with spheroids or organoids.",

      "release_date": "2024-07-02",
      "description": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homologue, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), are the main transcriptional downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Decreased Hippo pathway activity leads to nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ where they interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce target gene expression. Unrestrained YAP/TAZ activity can lead to excessive growth and tumor formation in a short time, underscoring the evolutionary need for tight control of these two transcriptional coactivators. \nHere, we report that the AP-1 component JUN acts as specific repressor of YAP/TAZ at joint target sites to decrease YAP/TAZ activity. This function of JUN is independent of its heterodimeric AP-1 partner FOS and the canonical AP-1 function. Since JUN is itself induced by YAP/TAZ, our work identifies a JUN-dependent negative feedback loop that buffers YAP/TAZ activity at joint sites. This negative feedback loop gets disrupted in liver cancer to unlock the full oncogenic potential of YAP/TAZ.\nOur results thus demonstrate an additional layer of control for the important interplay of YAP/TAZ and AP-1. \n",

      "release_date": "2024-08-15",
      "description": "Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, Automated Tape Collecting Ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy. However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed \u2018ATUM-Tomo\u2019, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films. ATUM-SEM of serial semi-thick sections and consecutive ET of selected re-mounted sections combines SEM\u2019s fast target recognition and coarse rendering capability with high-resolution volume visualizations, respectively, thus enabling multi-scale interrogation of cellular ultrastructure. As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Microthrombi and associated sites of BBB leakiness were identified by confocal imaging of injected fluorescent and electron-dense nanoparticles, then relocalized by ATUM-SEM, and finally interrogated by correlative ATUM-Tomo. This workflow is a seamless zoom-in on structural BBB pathology from the micro- to the nanometer scale. Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures.",

      "title": "Visualization of cellular membrane damage and apoptosis in murine precision cut lung slices after vibratome slicing",
      "release_date": "2024-07-22",
      "description": "Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) are increasingly being utilized to reduce animal usage (as more experiments can be performed on complex and multicellular tissues from a single animal) but also offer the potential to study cellular and tissue level processes directly in human tissue ex vivo. PCLS can be generated using several different techniques including a vibrating microtome (vibratome) or other commercial devices such as a Krumdieck slicer or Compresstome. Due to the potential damage from mechanical cutting of the tissue and from the cold ischemic time associated with tissue preparation, some labs report letting PCLS rest overnight or for 24 hours prior to starting experiments. However, there is limited data on what occurs immediately after slicing and what time window is optimal for PCLS recovery prior to the start of experiments. This is particularly important to determine if PCLS are to be used for evaluation of targeted therapies, such as nanoparticle therapies. Non-specific uptake due to cell membrane damage may obfuscate the interpretation of results. Previous papers in the PCLS field have utilized live/dead staining which relies on Calcein AM staining which is cleaved cleaved by intracellular esterases to yield Calcein fluorescence, which is only retained in live cells. In parallel, Ethidium homodimer I (or III) are used to label dead or dying cells as this dye is impermeant to intact cell membranes. Ethidium homodimer is weakly fluorescent at baseline but becomes highly fluorescent when complexed with nucleic acids. However, this approach has several drawbacks. 1) It does not yield insight into whether cell damage detected with Calcein AM is due to apoptosis or necrosis 2) Both dyes have excitation and emission spectra in ranges that overlap with lung tissue autofluorescence (Calcein AM ex=494nm and em=514nm; EtHD ex 527nm and em=624nm). Therefore, we sought to establish the feasibility of utilizing an active caspase3/7 sensitive dye (NucView\u00ae488) and a far red cell impermeable dye which more specifically labels nuclei (RedDot\u21222) to complement the information available in the literature to better understand the early dynamics in PCLS. These results help to establish suitable time windows for letting PCLS recover prior to beginning experiments, provide insight into the potential for apoptotic pathways to be initiated after slicing and help to establish when such live staining agents should be administered to evaluate potential cell death. We generated 300\u03bcm thick PCLS from agarose filled murine lungs and either immediately administered apoptosis/necrosis dyes or administered them 24 hours later. To test for dye stability and as a positive control for cellular damage, we administered 150\u03bcM hydrogen peroxide to some slices. Images were acquired using confocal microscopy using identical laser and microscope settings over multiple days. There was no internal calibration performed between days. ",

      "release_date": "2024-08-24",
      "description": "Transcriptional factors (TFs) act as key determinants of the coordination of cell death and survival by differentially modulating gene expression. Here, we systematically identified many TFs including condensate-forming TEAD4 in stressed cells. In sharp contrast to YAP-induced transcription-activating condensation of TEAD4, we found that co-factors such as VGLL4 and RFXANK could alternatively induce repressive condensation of TEAD4 to trigger cell death. Illustrated using VGLL4 as the cofactor, we mechanistically revealed that the heterotypic interactions between TEAD4 and VGLL4 favor the oligomerization and assembly of large condensates of TEAD4 to manifest a nonclassical inhibitory function of this transcription factor, i.e., causing DNA/chromatin to be aggregated and entangled, which eventually impede gene expression. Based on these findings, we engineered a linker peptide to selectively \u201cglue\u201d TEAD4 molecules together, thereby forcefully driving its condensation-induced repression of YAP-induced activation. This glue peptide displayed a strong antitumor effect via inhibition of TEAD4-related gene transcription. Collectively, this work revealed a new type of phase separation, i.e., repressive condensation of TFs, revealed how cofactor-induced differential condensation can orchestrate opposite functions of a given TF, and further developed a new class of antitumor strategies involving artificially inducing repressive condensation.

      "release_date": "2022-12-14",
      "description": "In this study, we found that mice lacking gut microbiota displayed increased blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier permeability associated with disorganized tight junctions (TJs), which can be rescued by recolonization with gut microbiota or supplementation with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We further confirmed that the vagus nerve plays an important role in this process but SCFAs can also bypass the vagus nerve and affect blood-CSF barrier functionality. Strikingly, the administration of SCFAs in AppNL-G-F AD mice also improved the localization of TJs in the blood-CSF barrier. This was accompanied by a pronounced reduction in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden, which could be achieved by regulating microglial phenotype. Altogether, our results suggest that modulating the microbiota or administering SCFAs might have therapeutic potential in AD via tightening blood-CSF barrier and maintaining microglial activity.",

      "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

      "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

      "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

      "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

      "title": "Cardamine wild type ovule atlas: A 3D digital cell atlas of wild-type Cardamine hirsuta ovule development with cellular and tissue resolution",
      "release_date": "2024-05-17",
      "description": "We present a 3D digital atlas of Cardamine hirsuta ovule development with cellular resolution. The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth (stage 1-I) to the mature pre-fertilization ovule (stage 3-VI). The atlas provides information about the number of cells, their tissue classification, and about characteristics of cellular morphology, such as cell size and shape, for nearly all cells of the ovule. The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

The data was originally acquired in 3D and only the focused planes were chosen to be part of the dataset. Therefore, there are some fields of view repeated with different planes of focus. This can be identified in the naming of the files. The data is already divided into training and test considering independent fields of view. It includes the raw images and preprocessed brightfield images. The data was acquired using the widefield microscope Axio Observer 7 (Zeiss) equipped with a Colibri 7 LED illumination (Zeiss), a 20x/0.8 Plan Apochromat objective (Zeiss) and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics).",

      "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication form between bacteria via small signal molecules that enables global gene regulation as a function of cell density. We applied a microfluidic mother machine to study the kinetics of the QS response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to additions and withdrawals of signal molecules. We traced the fast buildup and the subsequent considerably slower decay of a population-level and single-cell-level QS response. We applied a mathematical model to explain the results quantitatively. We found significant heterogeneity in QS on the single-cell level, which may result from variations in quorum-controlled gene expression and protein degradation. Heterogeneity correlates with cell lineage history, too. We used single-cell data to define and quantitatively characterize the population-level quorum state. We found that the population-level QS response is well-defined. The buildup of the quorum is fast upon signal molecule addition. At the same time, its decay is much slower following signal withdrawal, and the quorum may be maintained for several hours in the absence of the signal. Furthermore, the quorum sensing response of the population was largely repeatable in subsequent pulses of signal molecules.",

The staining was then segmented using Ilastik\u2019s pixel classifier workflow. Pixel probability maps and raw data were loaded into Ilastik\u2019s object classification workflow. 1000x1000 pixel regions of each tissue z-stack were cropped and used to train object classifiers. DAPI and Hud object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, single cells, or inseparable clusters of cells. Tau object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, incomplete circle, complete circle, and solid circle shapes. Data was processed as 500x500x20 blocks and applied over the entire image volumes. Data was exported as object identities and spreadsheets with information about the objects\u2019 classification and characteristics, which were then loaded into matlab code to match objects from each channel with colocalized objects."

      "release_date": "2023-04-11",
      "description": "Studies of postmortem human tissue provide insight into pathological processes, but are inherently limited by practical considerations that limit the scale at which tissue can be examined, and the obvious issue that the tissue reflects only one time point in a continuous disease process.  We approached this problem by adapting new tissue clearance techniques to an entire cortical area of human brain, which allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of neurons throughout the depth of the entire cortical thickness.  This approach allows detection of \u201crare\u201d events, that may be difficult to detect in standard 5 micron-thick paraffin sections. For example, it is well established that neurofibrillary tangles begin within a neuron, and ultimately, in at least some instances, persist in the brain even after the neuron has died. These are referred to as \u201cghost tangles\u201d, a term that appropriately implies their \u201cdifficult to see\u201d ephemeral qualities. We set out to find ghost tangles as one example of the power of the tissue clearance/image analysis techniques to detect rare events, and to learn what happens at the end point of a tangle\u2019s life history. We were able to identify 8103 AT8+ tau tangles, 132465 HuD+ neurons, and 299640 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Braak V-VI) and 4 AT8+ tau tangles, 200447 HuD+ neurons, and 462715 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with no significant tau pathology (Braak 0-I).  Among these data we located 57 ghost tangles, which makes them only 0.7% of the total tau tangles observed. We found that ghost tangles are more likely to be found in cortical layers 3 and 5 (49/57), with a select few scattered across other layers 1, 2, 4, and 6. This ability to find rare events, such as ghost tangles, in large enough quantities to statistically test their distribution exemplifies how tissue clearing can be used as a powerful tool for studying selective vulnerability or resilience to pathology across brain regions.",

The first tumor subtype T1 negatively correlated with DNA damage and immunological features including CD3, CD8, and PD-L1. The same features positively correlated with the tumor subtype T2. Tumor subtype T4 was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Compared with the status of subtypes T1 and T4, patients with subtype T3 had improved prognosis, and T3 was an independent prognostic factor with regard to UICC stage. Similarly, stroma subtypes were linked to distinct immunological features and metabolic pathways. Stroma subtype S4 had a better prognosis than S2. Subsequently, analyses based on an independent LUSC cohort treated by neoadjuvant therapy revealed that the S2 stroma subtype was associated with chemotherapy resistance. Clinically relevant patient subtypes as determined by tissue-based spatial metabolomics are a valuable addition to existing molecular classification systems. Metabolic differences among the subtypes and their associations with immunological features may contribute to the improvement of personalized therapy.",

      "description": "Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta's heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the \u2018Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY\u2019 (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY\u2019s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature.",

NRASWT HDLECs showed well-regulated lumen structures and tube formation, but NRASQ61R HDLECs exhibited sheet-like proliferation and the formation of capillary-like structures was markedly less than that of NRASWT HDLECs. The higher the proportion of NRASQ61R HDLECs (fluorescent cells), the greater the sheet-like proliferation and the fewer the capillary-like structures.  2B: In the stepwise examination of NRASQ61R HDLEC mixtures, the covered area (occupied area by cellular components) (a), total nets (number of nets) (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) were analyzed by WinTube.

However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment.

However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

      "description": "In Drosophila male gonads, niche-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has a role in maintaining stem cells in close proximity but the range of Dpp diffusion and its role has never been tested in the differentiating cells spaced one-cell layer away. Here, using genetically encoded nanobodies called Morphotraps, we physically block Dpp diffusion without interfering with niche-stem cell signaling and find that a diffusible fraction of Dpp is required to ensure differentiation of GSC daughter cells, opposite of its role in maintenance of GSC in the niche. Our work provides an example in which a soluble niche ligand induces opposed cellular responses in stem cells versus differentiating descendants to ensure spatial control of the niche, which may be a common mechanism to regulate tissue homeostasis.",

      "description": "The tight control of fate transitions during stem cell differentiation is essential for proper\ntissue development and maintenance. However, identifying how the multilayered regulation\nof gene expression programmes orchestrates stem cell differentiation in vivo remains\nelusive, because of the challenges in studying sparsely distributed adult stem cells in a\nsystematic manner. Here, we synchronised Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC)\ndifferentiation in vivo to perform in-depth transcriptome and translatome analyses at high\ndevelopmental resolution. This characterisation revealed widespread and dynamic changes\nin mRNA level, promoter usage, exon inclusion, and translation efficiency. Transient\nexpression of the master regulator, Bam, drives a first wave of expression changes, primarily\nmodifying the cell cycle programme. Surprisingly, as Bam levels recede, differentiating cells\nreturn to a remarkably stem cell-like transcription and translation programme, with a few\ncrucial changes feeding into a second phase driving terminal differentiation to form the\noocyte. Altogether, these findings reveal that rather than a unidirectional accumulation of\nchanges, the in vivo differentiation programme relies on distinctly regulated and\ndevelopmentally sequential waves.",

Correct scale was set (in \u00b5m) under \u2018Properties\u2019. Parameters that should be quantified were selected under \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u2018Set 3D Measurements\u2019. To perform the analysis, \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u20183D object counter\u2019 was selected. Threshold for the intensity limit (areas below that limit were not considered for quantification) was set manually for every z-stack. Calculated values were further processed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Only size between 0,01-15 \u00b5m\u00b3 was considered. The reason for preferring manual versus automatic image adjustments is as follows: FIT NBs were numerous with varying size and signal intensity. We had found that a fixed threshold for intensity within the ImageJ software caused a loss of NBs when present but below the set threshold. To avoid this, manual inspection was preferred when using the ImageJ software to segment correctly."

      "release_date": "2024-01-22",
      "description": "Diabetes is caused by the inability of electrically coupled, functionally heterogeneous \u03b2-cells within the pancreatic islet to provide adequate insulin secretion. Functional networks have been used to represent synchronized oscillatory [Ca2+] dynamics and to study \u03b2-cell subpopulations, which play an important role in driving islet function. The mechanism by which highly synchronized \u03b2-cell subpopulations drive islet function is unclear. We used experimental and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between functional networks, structural (gap-junction) networks, and intrinsic \u03b2-cell dynamics in slow and fast oscillating islets. Highly synchronized subpopulations in the functional network were differentiated by intrinsic dynamics, including metabolic activity and KATP channel conductance, more than structural coupling. Consistent with this, intrinsic dynamics were more predictive of high synchronization in the islet functional network as compared to high levels of structural coupling. Finally, dysfunction of gap junctions, which can occur in diabetes, caused decreases in the efficiency and clustering of the functional network. These results indicate that intrinsic dynamics rather than structure drive connections in the functional network and highly synchronized subpopulations, but gap junctions are still essential for overall network efficiency. These findings deepen our interpretation of functional networks and the formation of functional sub-populations in dynamic tissues such as the islet.\u2003",

      "description": "During asymmetric cell division, cell polarity is coordinated with the cell cycle to allow proper inheritance of cell fate determinants and generation of cellular diversity. In the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) zygote, polarity is governed by evolutionarily conserved Partitioning (PAR) proteins that segregate to opposing cortical domains to specify asymmetric cell fates. Timely establishment of PAR domains requires a cell cycle kinase, Aurora A (AIR-1 in C. elegans). Aurora A depletion by RNAi causes a spectrum of phenotypes including reversed polarity,  excess posterior domains, and no posterior domain. How depletion of a single kinase can cause seemingly opposite phenotypes remains obscure. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system and drug treatments, we found that AIR-1 regulates polarity differently at different times of the cell cycle. During meiosis I, AIR-1 acts to prevent later formation of bipolar domains, while in meiosis II, AIR-1 is necessary to recruit PAR-2 onto the membrane. Together these data clarify the origin of multiple polarization phenotypes in RNAi experiments and reveal multiple roles of AIR-1 in coordinating PAR protein localization with cell cycle progression.

      "release_date": "2024-03-30",
      "description": "Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient needed in many metabolic processes. To balance needs and potential toxicity, plants control the amount of Fe they take up and allocate to leaves and seeds during their development. One important regulator of this process is POPEYE (PYE). PYE is a Fe deficiency-induced key bHLH transcription factor (TF) for allocation of internal Fe in plants. In the absence of PYE, there is altered Fe translocation and plants develop a leaf chlorosis. NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE4 (NAS4), FERRIC-REDUCTION OXIDASE3 (FRO3), and ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR1 (ZIF1) genes are expressed at higher level in pye-1 indicating that PYE represses these genes. PYE activity is controlled in a yet unknown manner. Here, we show that a small Fe deficiency-induced protein OLIVIA (OLV) can interact with PYE. OLV has a conserved C-terminal motif, that we named TGIYY. Through deletion mapping, we pinpointed that OLV TGIYY and several regions of PYE can be involved in the protein interaction. An OLV overexpressing (OX) mutant line exhibited an enhanced NAS4 gene expression. This was a mild Fe deficiency response phenotype that was related to PYE function. Leaf rosettes of olv mutants remained smaller than those of wild type, indicating that OLV promotes plant growth. Taken together, our study identified a small protein OLV as a candidate that may connect aspects of Fe homeostasis with regulation of leaf growth.",

In short, we developed an unbiased approach to profile the shape of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in Fiji 60. The \u03b1-actinin channel was utilized for segmentation. The workflow consisted of a pre-processing step in which the median filter was applied to the input images in order to reduce noise. Then, the images were segmented using the Li\u2019s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method. To avoid any bias in quantifying segmented cardiomyocytes between different treatments, we excluded all cropped cells that were on the images\u2019 edges. We also excluded segmented particles with an area smaller than 50000 pixels.\nTo quantify the changes in cell shape upon treatments, we utilized the minimum caliper diameter (MinFeret shape descriptor in Fiji), which measures the smallest diameter between any two points at the boundary of a segmented object. We also utilized the area of the segmented objects to visualize changes in cardiomyocytes\u2019 size upon different treatments. However, NRCMs in 2D culture acquire a variety of random shapes and sizes, and the diversity in the shapes and sizes were further greatly enhanced by the SF and NAC treatments, which also affected the identifications of contiguous cells\u2019 boundaries. This fact made it impossible to segment all individual cardiomyocytes, especially in the NAC treatment, where cells were hypertrophied and more intertwined. This problem was not even possible to resolve by manual curation of cells\u2019 borders or by staining the cytoplasmic membrane. As our interest was to quantify the changes in cell area and diameter between different treatments, we segmented connected cells as one object. We segmented 6 images from the control group, and 8 images from each of SF and NAC treatments. The segmentation resulted in 123-196 objects per image. For each object of each image, we computed the area and minimum diameter. To plot them, we pooled the measures of each condition together. Pooling them resulted in groups of values, in which each value originated from one image (6 for the control condition,8 for NAC and 8 for SF treatments). Then we calculated the average of each group. This resulted in 148 objects in the control condition, 144 objects in the NAC treatment, and 196 objects in the SF treatment as shown in the Source Data File. These averaged values of the segmented objects\u2019 area and MinFeret were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The implemented image analysis pipeline is available in Github (https://github.com/BIIFSweden/CellGeometryProfiling)."

      "description": "Redox homeostasis modulates the morphology of cardiomyocytes\nRedox homeostasis is affected in heart failure. Remodelling of heart failure has been associated with enhanced ROS production due to alterations in the excitation-contraction coupling, or due to altered cytoplasmic calcium handling (M\u00fcnzel, Gori et al. 2015). However, these alterations are met by adaptations of the antioxidative system to restore redox homeostasis. We have noted that redox induces changes to cardiomyocytes geometry, where oxidative stress induces cardiomyocytes\u2019 elongation and atrophy, while antioxidative compounds promotes cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. These alterations in the cardiomyocyte\u2019s geometry resemble the changes observed to geometry of the heart during heart failure and indicate that intracellular redox homeostasis is involved in regulating the morphology of cardiomyocytes. We quantitatively measured these alterations in cell morphology upon treating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with a pro-oxidant (Sulforaphane, SF) and an antioxidant (N-Acetyl Cysteine, NAC). We utilized florescence microscopic imaging, followed by image analysis with ImageJ. This experiment is part of a study that investigates the impact of endogenous antioxidative defenses in the heart and the potentially adverse effects associated with excessive quenching of physiological levels of reactive oxygen species, which act as cellular signalling molecules. The study is now available as a pre-pint on BioRxiv (Epigenetic modulators link mitochondrial redox homeostasis to cardiac function a sex-dependent manner, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.26.485908), and under consideration for publication in Nature Communications.",

The distinctive feature of SD-SIM was the Live-SR module (GATACA system) which was set up on a commercial inverted fluorescence microscope (IX83, Olympus) equipped with a scanning disk confocal system (Yokogawa, CSU-X1). All experiments used 100\u00d7, 1.30 numerical aperture (NA) oil objective lens and two laser beams 405 nm and 488 nm. Images were acquired with EMCCD (Andor, iXon3 897) and sCMOS (Hamamatsu, c14440-20up). All images were possessed with ImageJ software and sparse deconvolved with a commercial software (MicroscopeX FINER, CSR Biotech).",

      "description": "Although mitochondrial morphology changes have been consistently associated with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ageing, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms at play have remained somewhat obscure. Using a live-cell super-resolution (SR) microscopy technique, we have been able to identify different HSCs subsets that feature mitochondria of distinct morphologies and spatial distributions. Integrating SR microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled us to classify approximately two hundred HSCs from both young and aged mice into five discrete clusters. These clusters show molecular profiles that mirror the varying states of mitochondria. Our integrated approach of RNA biomarker analysis and potential regulon assessment has unveiled hitherto unrecognized functions of GDF15 in mediating mitochondrial signals and morphologies that direct HSCs fate. Therefore, the combination of SR imaging with bioinformatics pipeline offers a notably effective method for the identification of critical molecular players in specific phases of cellular transition, utilizing a relatively small dataset.

    "description": "Fast, accurate and affordable bacterial identification methods are paramount for timely treatment of infections, especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). However, today only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach by the acquisition and the subsequent analysis comprising 252 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and inter- species variability, a scenario more akin to the real-world clinical practice rather than the one achievable solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite the variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7 %. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.",

      "release_date": "2024-04-03",
      "description": "Fast, accurate and affordable bacterial identification methods are paramount for timely treatment of infections, especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). However, today only 1.3% of the sub-Saharan African diagnostic laboratories are performing clinical bacteriology. To improve this, diagnostic tools for RLS should prioritize simplicity, affordability, and ease of maintenance, as opposed to the costly equipment utilized for bacterial identification in high-income countries, such as such as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In this work, we present a new high-throughput approach based on a simple wide field (864 mm2) lensless imaging system allowing for the acquisition of a large portion of a Petri dish coupled with a supervised deep learning algorithm for identification at the bacterial colony scale. This wide-field imaging system is particularly well suited to RLS since it includes neither moving mechanical parts nor optics. We validated this approach by the acquisition and the subsequent analysis comprising 257 clinical isolates from five species, encompassing some of the most prevalent pathogens. The resulting optical morphotypes exhibited intra- and inter- species variability, a scenario more akin to the real-world clinical practice rather than the one achievable solely concentrating on reference strains. Despite the variability, high identification performance was achieved with a correct species identification rate of 91.7 %. These results open up some new prospects for identification in RLS.",

      "title": "Characterization of the Disease-Causing Mechanism of KIF3B Mutations from Ciliopathy Patients",
      "release_date": "2024-04-12",
      "description": "The heterodimeric kinesin-2 motor (KIF3A/KIF3B with accessory protein KAP3) drives intraflagellar transport, essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary function. Three point mutations in the KIF3B subunit have recently been linked to disease in humans (E250Q and L523P) and Bengal cats (A334T) (Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2020). Patients display retinal atrophy and, in some cases, other ciliopathy phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism leading to disease is currently unknown. Here, we used Kif3a-/-;Kif3b-/- (knockout) 3T3 cells, which cannot make cilia, to characterize these mutations. While reexpression of KIF3B(E250Q) and KIF3B(L523P) did not rescue ciliogenesis, reexpression of wildtype or KIF3B(A334T), restored ciliogenesis to wildtype levels. Fluorescent tagging revealed that the E250Q mutant decorated microtubules and thus is a rigor mutation. The L523P mutation, in the alpha-helical stalk domain, surprisingly did not affect formation of the KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3 complex but instead impaired motility along microtubules. Lastly, expression of the A334T motor was reduced in comparison to all other conditions and displayed an impaired ability to disperse the Golgi complex when artificially linked to this high-load cargo. In summary, this work uses cell-based assays to elucidates the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations in the KIF3B subunit on the kinesin-2 holoenzyme.",

For the whole embryos obtained previously (47) that are used in this study, the first and last 3rd cleavage divisions occur between 0 and 2 h from each other. To compare the timing of whole embryos and doublets, we used the mean delay between cleavage divisions of whole embryos as the time after 3rd cleavage.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the contact angle of cell-cell contacts in whole embryos and doublets. Using the angle tool, the equatorial plane in which two contacting cells are observed is chosen to manually measure the external contact angle. Data of compacting whole WT embryos are taken from freely available time lapse images obtained previously (47).\nTo measure the size of contacts on doublets, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure length of contact at its equatorial plane.\nTo measure the size of micropipettes, the line tool of FIJI is used to manually measure the inner diameter near the tip.\n\nImmunostaining\nDoublets are imaged and synchronized using the 3rd cleavage division from 4- to 8-cell stage before being fixed and stained.\nWe use FIJI (48) to measure the intensity of Cdh1 and filamentous actin (phalloidin) in doublets to determine their distribution (i) at the cell-cell contact vs the cell-medium interfaces, (ii) at the contact rim vs central disc and (iii) at the contact edge vs inner contact.\n(i) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact and cell-medium interface, we measured the intensity Icc at cell-cell contacts and intensities Icm1 and Icm2 at the free surface of contacting cells 1 and 2. A 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line is manually drawn at the equatorial plane of the cell doublet to measure the mean intensities Icc, Icm1 and Icm2 at the corresponding interfaces.\n(ii) To determine the intensity ratio between the contact rim and central disc, we measured the intensities Idisc and Iring, with the latter one defined as a 1 \u00b5m thick circle at the rim of the contact. A 4 \u00b5m wide rectangle is drawn along the cell-cell contact to project it along the z axis using 3D project and interpolation functions of FIJI. On the projection, a circle is manually drawn around the entire cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. A 2 \u00b5m smaller circle is then positioned onto the center of the cell-cell contact to measure its total intensity and area. To calculate the mean intensity Idisc, the total intensity of the small circle is divided by its area. To calculate the mean intensity Iring, the total intensity of the small circle is subtracted to the one of the large circle, the resulting intensity is divided by the area of the large circle to which the area of the small circle is subtracted.\n(iii) To account for the potential influence of depth of imaging in the analysis of the ring enrichment, we also performed a 2D analysis of Cdh1 and actin reorganization at the contact. Using a circle of radius 1 \u00b5m centered on the edge of contact, we measure the intensities of signal at both contact edges Iedge1 and Iedge2 of the equatorial plane of contact. We then measure intensity along the inner part of the cell-cell contact Iinner contact (excluding the edges) using a 1 \u00b5m thick segmented line. We then calculate the ratio between the average Iedge1 and Iedge2 and the Iinner contact.\n"

      "description": "Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density. ",

For all channels, we provide cell-level datasets including sensory cortical areas on cellular level (0.54 x 0.54 x 4\u00b5m XYZ). The data provide insight into cell distribution, cell densities and fibre directions in the neocortex.\n",

The folder contains images of the processing in regards to the complete image and separate images of individual ROIs. ROIs are represented as yellow contour. The orientation of the membranes was tracked (blue sticks) and their coherency was computed. Local coherencies were visualized as thin red sticks of a certain length and angle emphasized by background colour. Global coherencies where shown as thick red sticks. Density functions revealed the distribution of local coherencies and the resulting mean local coherency and global coherency. The directions of local coherencies within each ROI were plotted as polar histograms respecting the 180-degree-symmetry and showed the computed angle of the global coherency. ",

The folder contains images of the processing in regards to the complete image and separate images of individual ROIs. ROIs are represented as yellow contour. The orientation of the membranes was tracked (blue sticks) and their coherency was computed. Local coherencies were visualized as thin red sticks of a certain length and angle emphasized by background colour. Global coherencies where shown as thick red sticks. Density functions revealed the distribution of local coherencies and the resulting mean local coherency and global coherency. The directions of local coherencies within each ROI were plotted as polar histograms respecting the 180-degree-symmetry and showed the computed angle of the global coherency. ",

      "title": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches respiratory epithelia through goblet cell invasion in a microtissue model",
      "release_date": "2024-04-11",
      "description": "While commensal bacteria generally respect natural barriers of the human body, pathogens are able to breach epithelia, invade deeper tissue layers and cause life-threatening infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen, is a leading cause of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, with mortality rates up to 50% in mechanically ventilated patients1\u20133. Effective colonization and breaching of lung mucosa are hallmarks of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis4. Although virulence factors and behavioral strategies of P. aeruginosa have been described5,6, it has remained unclear how this pathogen disseminates on functional mucosal surfaces, how it avoids mucociliary clearance and how it invades the tissue barrier. Using fully differentiated human lung epithelia, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa efficiently spreads on the apical tissue surface before it breaches epithelia by preferentially invading mucus secreting goblet cells. Internalization leads to host cell death and expulsion and the formation of ruptures of the epithelial barrier. Rupture sites are rapidly colonized by extracellular bacteria through active chemotaxis, leading to increasing tissue damage and successful pathogen translocation to the unprotected basolateral side of the epithelium. We show that cell invasion is promoted by two Type-6 toxin secretion systems (T6SS), while Type-3 (T3SS) mediates cell death of infected goblet cells. T3SS mutants invade goblet cells normally, but internalized bacteria fail to trigger goblet cell expulsion and instead show unrestrained intracellular replication. While the effective shedding of infected host cells reveals potent tissue protection mechanisms, the discovery of an intracellular lifestyle of P. aeruginosa in pseudostratified human lung epithelia provides new entry points into investigating the intersection of antibiotic and immune mechanisms during lung infections. By demonstrating that P. aeruginosa uses a combination of specific virulence factors and collective behavior to invade goblet cells and breach the lung tissue barrier from within, these studies reveal novel mechanisms underlying lung infection dynamics under physiological conditions.

      "release_date": "2024-03-15",
      "description": "Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to cilia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for DLG1, a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, the retromer-associated protein SDCCAG3, IFT20 and polycystin-2 (PC2) were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 variant, p.T489R. Finally, biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling suggested that SDCCAG3 and IFT20 form a complex that associates, at least indirectly, with DLG1. Our work identifies a key role for DLG1 in regulating ciliary protein composition and suggests that ciliary dysfunction of the p.T489R DLG1 variant may contribute to CAKUT.  ",

      "description": "Astrocytic dysfunction has been previously described in Parkinson's, but the role of astrocytic gap junctional networks has not been explored. Connexin 43 is the major protein linking astrocytes in networks across the brain. In the present dataset, images from three cortical areas (parietal, frontal, and insular) and basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, midbrain substantia nigra) were collected from 20 people with Parkinson's and 20 age-matched controls to reveal downregulation in connexin 43 punctate staining in Parkinson's. Punctate pattern was specifically affected in disease, which may indicate dysfunction in gap junctional coupling.",

      "release_date": "2024-05-06",
      "description": "The zebrafish Danio rerio has become a popular model host to explore disease pathology caused by infectious agents. A main advantage is its transparency at an early age, which enables live imaging of infection dynamics. While multispecies infections are common in patients, the zebrafish model is rarely used to study them, although the model would be ideal for investigating pathogen-pathogen and pathogen-host interactions. This may be due to the absence of an established multispecies infection protocol for a defined organ and the lack of suitable image analysis pipelines for automated image processing. To address these issues, we developed a protocol for establishing and tracking single and multispecies bacterial infections in the inner ear structure (otic vesicle) of the zebrafish by imaging. Subsequently, we generated an image analysis pipeline that involved deep learning for the automated segmentation of the otic vesicle, and scripts for the quantification of pathogen frequencies through fluorescence intensity measures. We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, three of the difficult-to-treat ESKAPE pathogens, to show that our infection protocol and image analysis pipeline work both for single pathogens and pairwise pathogen combinations. Thus, our protocols provide a comprehensive toolbox for studying single and multispecies infections in real-time in zebrafish.",

For example, the tumour suppressor TP53/TRP53 can initiate diverse cellular responses by transcriptional activation of its target genes: Puma to induce apoptotic cell death and p21 to induce cell cycle arrest/cell senescence. However, it is not known how these processes are regulated and initiated in different cell types. To be able to examine this, we developed triple-FLAG TRP53 knock-in mice for TRP53 pull-down and two TRP53 response reporter mice, knocking tdTomato or GFP into the Puma/Bbc3 or p21 gene loci, respectively. By crossing the reporter mice onto a TRP53-deficient background, we could show that these reporters reliably inform on TRP53-dependent and TRP53-independent initiation of the apoptotic as well as the cell cycle arrest/senescence programs in vitro and even in vivo.

      "description": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a prevalent neurological disorder that imposes a significant burden on children, families, and society worldwide. Recently, the RhoB p.S73F mutation was identified as a de novo mutation associated with CP. However, the mechanism by which the RhoB p.S73F mutation causes CP is currently unclear. In this study, rabbit models were generated to mimic the human RhoB p.S73F mutation using the SpG-BE4max system, and exhibited the typical symptoms of human CP, such as periventricular leukomalacia and spastic-dystonic diplegia. Further investigation revealed that the RhoB p.S73F mutation could activate ACAT1 through the LYN pathway, and the subsequently altered lipid levels may lead to neuronal and white matter damage resulting in the development of CP. This study presented the first mammalian model of genetic CP that accurately replicates RhoB p.S73F mutation in humans, provided further insights between RhoB and lipid metabolism, and novel therapeutic targets for human CP.",

        "features_analysed": "Data analysis\nData are analysed using Microsoft Excel and R 3.5.2. Data are plotted using Graphpad Prism 9.5.1.\n\nInverse bleb count\nThe inverse bleb number in confocal and light-sheet time lapses is manually counted. A bleb is defined as a transient hemispherical actin-positive intrusion appearing at cell-cell contacts. \nWhen embryos are imaged every minute continuously throughout lumen formation, the number of blebs is provided as such. When embryos are sampled every 5 or 10 s, the number of blebs is provided per min.\nInverse blebs are allocated to TE or ICM cells based on the position of the cells: TE cells contact the surface of the embryo while ICM cells are surrounded by other cells.\nInverse blebs are allocated into a distal and proximal half by determining the site of blastocoel formation in the equatorial plane and bisecting the embryo in two equal halves.\nInverse blebs are allocated to: (1) a bicellular interface when they do not touch a multicellular interface and are oriented away from the bicellular interface; (2) a multicellular interface when they touch that interface and are oriented away from the multicellular interface; (3) an unclear category when they touch a multicellular interface and are oriented away from a neighboring bicellular interface,\n\nDuration of the microlumen phase\nMicrolumen duration of embryos, quartets and doublets is determined as the time between the appearance of the first and disappearance of the last microlumens as detected visually.\n\nDynamics of individual inverse blebs\nInverse bleb dynamics are measured using FIJI by tracing the outline of inverse blebs using a line width of 1 \u00b5m. Before and after inverse bleb formation and retraction, a line corresponding to the opening width of the inverse bleb is measured. For each inverse bleb, measurements are taken 82.5 s before and after reaching their maximum size (90 s after size maximum for para-Nitroblebbistatin treatment).\nThe time of maximal size of each inverse bleb is taken as a reference time point. Intensity values of LifeAct-GFP, MYH9-GFP, CDH1-GFP and mTmG are first normalized to 82.5 s before inverse bleb size maximum and then to their minimal and maximal values. The lifetime of an inverse bleb is taken as the time during which a visible membrane protrusion is seen extending at a cell-cell contact until the time it is no longer visible. The retraction time is taken as the time of inverse bleb duration from its maximal size to its disappearance.\nUsing R segmented package54, the LifeAct-GFP and MYH9-GFP recruitment times are calculated using iterative linear regression on the intensity data taken until the maximum value to find the breakpoint between the stable intensity and intensity increase.\n\nBlastocoel volume\nBlastocoel volume is measured on full-volume light sheet z-stacks using the FIJI plugin LimeSeg55. The blastocoel is traced back from the expanded blastocyst and measured as soon as a lumen is present (smallest segmented lumen < 1 pL). Before that, blastocoel volume is assumed to be 0 pL.\n\nStatistics\nStatistical test were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1. Statistical significance is considered when p < 10\u22122. \nThe sample size was not predetermined and simply results from the repetition of experiments. No sample was excluded. No randomization method was used. The investigators were not blinded during experiments.\n"

      "title": "Inverse blebs operate as hydraulic pumps during mouse blastocyst formation",
      "release_date": "2024-06-14",
      "description": "During preimplantation development, mouse embryos form a fluid-filled lumen, which sets their first axis of symmetry1,2. Pressurized fluid breaks open cell-cell contacts and accumulates into pockets, which gradually coarsen into a single lumen3\u20135. During coarsening, cellular adhesive and contractile properties are thought to guide intercellular fluid (IF) but what cell behavior may control fluid movements is unknown. Here, we report large fluid-filled spherical membrane intrusions called inverse blebs6,7 growing into cells at adhesive contacts. At the onset of lumen coarsening, we observed hundreds of inverse blebs throughout the embryo, each dynamically filling with IF and retracting within a minute. We find that inverse blebs grow due to pressure build-up resulting from luminal fluid accumulation and cell-cell adhesion, which locally confines fluid. Inverse blebs then retract due to actomyosin contraction, which effectively redistributes fluid within the intercellular space. Importantly, inverse blebs show topological specificity and mostly occur at contacts between two cells, rarely at contacts formed by multiple cells, which essentially serve as fluid sinks. Manipulating the topology of the embryo reveals that, in the absence of sinks, inverse blebs pump fluid into one another in a futile cycle. We propose that inverse blebs operate as hydraulic pumps to promote luminal coarsening, thereby constituting an instrument used by cells to control fluid movement.",

For the leaf length, a line was drawn centrally from the leaf base to the leaf tip. The leaf width is a line orthogonal to the leaf length at the height of the first half of the leaf. For the leaf area, the images of the entire leaf were segmented in the Labkit plugin. The resulting classifier and the mask were saved separately. The segmented image was then opened in ImageJ/Fiji and edited if necessary. Editing involved removing excess objects that interfered with the measurement or extended leaf veins that were pulled out of the stem, for example in the segmentations of the species Bryum sp. Finally, the segmentations were saved and measured using the \u201cMagic Wand\u201d tool and the measurement method included in ImageJ/Fiji. The scale of the original image was previously set to \u201cGlobal\u201d in the settings so that the segmentation corresponds to the same scale. Overlapping leaf areas or obviously missing areas, e.g. broken leaf parts, were then marked and measured in the original image using a polygon selection. The resulting values were then added together in the final data table. The cell images were measured without additional segmentation. From each of the three images, a random cell was measured from the center of the image. Only lamina cells were measured. For the length, the distance between the two farthest ends of a cell was used, while the width was recorded as a line orthogonal to it. The width and height were recorded in the images of the cross sections. Width is determined by a line centered between the two farthest ends of the cross-section, while height is determined by measuring individual cells along a line orthogonal to the width of the cross-section. For plants that have a midrib in their leaves, the width and height of the midrib could also be measured. The width was measured using a central line between the two furthest points of the midrib. The height was determined using a central line orthogonal to the width of the midrib. For the species Grimmia pulvinata, the length of the glass hair was also measured. For this purpose, a line was drawn from the base of the glass hair to the tip and measured.\n\n(*translated with DeepL)"

      "description": "In order to test the combination of a microscope and mobile phone to take bioImages, samples of plants such as leaves, petals and seeds were collected from around the Wellcome Genome Campus in Hinxton.  Each sample was dissected into small pieces and mounted on glass slides then placed under the lens whilst a attachment that held the phone over the eyepice of the microscope was fixed in place. As the phone would automatically focus the image, it was difficult to gauge how much more focus the sample required because the auto-focus would change everytime the microscope stage was moved to focus. As a result, the auto-focus was switched off before the images were taken. The phone magnification was kept at 1x so not to affect the images and each change in magnification of the microscope was recorded. ",
