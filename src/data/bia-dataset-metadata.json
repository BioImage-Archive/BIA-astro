            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth (stage 1-I) to the mature pre-fertilization ovule (stage 3-VI). The atlas provides information about the number of cells, their tissue classification, and about characteristics of cellular morphology, such as cell size and shape, for nearly all cells of the ovule. The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

It includes control (healthy) cells and cells that were previously illuminated with 385 nm (UV), 475 nm and 630 nm wavelengths. The data was originally acquired in 3D and only the focused planes were chosen to be part of the dataset. Therefore, there are some fields of view repeated with different planes of focus. This can be identified in the naming of the files. The data is already divided into training and test considering independent fields of view. It includes the raw images and preprocessed brightfield images. The data was acquired using the widefield microscope Axio Observer 7 (Zeiss) equipped with a Colibri 7 LED illumination (Zeiss), a 20x/0.8 Plan Apochromat objective (Zeiss) and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics).",
