            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

            "description": "Astrocytes in the brain exhibit distinct regional heterogeneity contributing uniquely to regional circuits for higher-order brain functions, yet the mechanisms governing their allocation remain unknown. Here we show that the precise allocation of astrocytes to specific brain regions is achieved through the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4)-mediated fate restriction based on their embryonic origin during brain development. Loss of Tcf4 in ventral telencephalic neural progenitors alters the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors to transient intermediate astrocyte precursors, resulting in mislocated astrocytes in the dorsal neocortex. These ectopic astrocytes originated from the ventral telencephalon engage with neurons and acquire features reminiscent of dorsal neocortical astrocytes. Furthermore, Tcf4 functions as a suppressor of astrocyte fate during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors derived from the ventral telencephalon, thereby restricting the fate to oligodendrocyte lineage in the dorsal neocortex. Mutations in TCF4 lead to Pitt-Hopkins syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of Tcf4 in regulating astrocyte allocation and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Tcf4 mutations.

The complete stagewise ovule dataset is organized by developmental stage. Each developmental stage dataset includes at least 10 samples and each ovule sample possesses a unique sample ID. Sample IDs correspond to 3D z-stacks. Each sample dataset includes raw cell boundaries stack (cell boundaries marked by the cell wall stain SR2200) and nuclei stain stack (TO-PRO3 iodide) obtained from confocal microscopy, neural network-based cell boundary predictions from PlantSeg (https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg), 3D segmented cells stack from the cell boundary predictions using GASP, the annotated 3D cell meshes along with their annotated parent labels in csv format, and the associated cell attribute files in csv format. The 3D mesh files can be opened in the open source software MorphoGraphX (MGX) (www.morphographx.org), the mesh file can be reconverted to obj, stl, ply or any other format of interest in MGX. The high-quality dataset includes 145 wild-type Cardamine hirsuta 3D digital ovules comprising stages 1-I to 3-VI. The file list below includes the sample IDs and their corresponding stages. We also provide the sample-specific cell attributes extracted from 3D cell meshes in MGX. \n\nNomenclature of ovule IDs\n\nA few image stacks comprise multiple ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. In such instances for stages 2-III to 3-VI, the format \"xxxx_A\" represents one ovule of an image stack with more than one ovule attached to the same pistil fragment. For further analysis with the mesh, individual ovules were classified as \"xxxx_A\", \"xxxx_B\", \"xxxx_C\" etc. For example, the dataset \"1785\" encompasses 2 ovules attached to the same pistil fragment. Ovules \"1785A\", \"1785B\" etc represent the individual ovules. One can open the 1785_A mesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the cells in the mesh. The labels are integer values that represent tissue IDs. In general, we follow a pattern of 1-10 tissue labels, except for stages 1-I to 2-II. In case of primordia sample IDs containing mutliple ovules, one can open the ID_cellmesh and enable the parents to display the labels annotated to the radial layers. In this case, the labels are integer values that represent radial layers of each primordium for example, in the same sample ID of primordia, parent labels \"1-3\" represent \"ID_A\" or ovule \"A\", \"11-13\" represent \"ID_B\", \"21-23\" represent \"ID_C\" and so on.\n\nDownload of latest version of MorphoGraphX\n\nTo obtain the latest version of MorphoGraphX please visit the MorphoGraphX website (www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) or contact Richard Smith by email (Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk)\n\nOrganism- Cardamine hirsuta\nxxxx_cellboundary Z stack of raw confocal images of cell walls stained with SR2200\nxxxx_nstain Z stack of raw confocal images of nuclei stained with To-Pro-3 iodide\nxxxx_cellboundary_prediction Z stack of neural network based cell boundary predictions obtained from PlantSeg using the raw cell boundary stack.\nxxxx_segmentation Z stack of cells segmented in 3D generated from the cell boundary predictions\nxxxx_cellmesh Cell mesh generated from the segmented stack.

It includes control (healthy) cells and cells that were previously illuminated with 385 nm (UV), 475 nm and 630 nm wavelengths. The data was originally acquired in 3D and only the focused planes were chosen to be part of the dataset. Therefore, there are some fields of view repeated with different planes of focus. This can be identified in the naming of the files. The data is already divided into training and test considering independent fields of view. It includes the raw images and preprocessed brightfield images. The data was acquired using the widefield microscope Axio Observer 7 (Zeiss) equipped with a Colibri 7 LED illumination (Zeiss), a 20x/0.8 Plan Apochromat objective (Zeiss) and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics).",

            "description": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication form between bacteria via small signal molecules that enables global gene regulation as a function of cell density. We applied a microfluidic mother machine to study the kinetics of the QS response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to additions and withdrawals of signal molecules. We traced the fast buildup and the subsequent considerably slower decay of a population-level and single-cell-level QS response. We applied a mathematical model to explain the results quantitatively. We found significant heterogeneity in QS on the single-cell level, which may result from variations in quorum-controlled gene expression and protein degradation. Heterogeneity correlates with cell lineage history, too. We used single-cell data to define and quantitatively characterize the population-level quorum state. We found that the population-level QS response is well-defined. The buildup of the quorum is fast upon signal molecule addition. At the same time, its decay is much slower following signal withdrawal, and the quorum may be maintained for several hours in the absence of the signal. Furthermore, the quorum sensing response of the population was largely repeatable in subsequent pulses of signal molecules.",

The staining was then segmented using Ilastik\u2019s pixel classifier workflow. Pixel probability maps and raw data were loaded into Ilastik\u2019s object classification workflow. 1000x1000 pixel regions of each tissue z-stack were cropped and used to train object classifiers. DAPI and Hud object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, single cells, or inseparable clusters of cells. Tau object classifiers were trained by manually classifying objects as noise, incomplete circle, complete circle, and solid circle shapes. Data was processed as 500x500x20 blocks and applied over the entire image volumes. Data was exported as object identities and spreadsheets with information about the objects\u2019 classification and characteristics, which were then loaded into matlab code to match objects from each channel with colocalized objects."

            "release_date": "2023-04-11",
            "description": "Studies of postmortem human tissue provide insight into pathological processes, but are inherently limited by practical considerations that limit the scale at which tissue can be examined, and the obvious issue that the tissue reflects only one time point in a continuous disease process.  We approached this problem by adapting new tissue clearance techniques to an entire cortical area of human brain, which allows surveillance of hundreds of thousands of neurons throughout the depth of the entire cortical thickness.  This approach allows detection of \u201crare\u201d events, that may be difficult to detect in standard 5 micron-thick paraffin sections. For example, it is well established that neurofibrillary tangles begin within a neuron, and ultimately, in at least some instances, persist in the brain even after the neuron has died. These are referred to as \u201cghost tangles\u201d, a term that appropriately implies their \u201cdifficult to see\u201d ephemeral qualities. We set out to find ghost tangles as one example of the power of the tissue clearance/image analysis techniques to detect rare events, and to learn what happens at the end point of a tangle\u2019s life history. We were able to identify 8103 AT8+ tau tangles, 132465 HuD+ neurons, and 299640 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Braak V-VI) and 4 AT8+ tau tangles, 200447 HuD+ neurons, and 462715 DAPI+ nuclei in tissue samples from three subjects with no significant tau pathology (Braak 0-I).  Among these data we located 57 ghost tangles, which makes them only 0.7% of the total tau tangles observed. We found that ghost tangles are more likely to be found in cortical layers 3 and 5 (49/57), with a select few scattered across other layers 1, 2, 4, and 6. This ability to find rare events, such as ghost tangles, in large enough quantities to statistically test their distribution exemplifies how tissue clearing can be used as a powerful tool for studying selective vulnerability or resilience to pathology across brain regions.",

Combining high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry with consensus clustering, four tumor- and four stroma-specific subtypes with distinct metabolite patterns were identified in 330 LUSC patients. The first tumor subtype T1 negatively correlated with DNA damage and immunological features including CD3, CD8, and PD-L1. The same features positively correlated with the tumor subtype T2. Tumor subtype T4 was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Compared with the status of subtypes T1 and T4, patients with subtype T3 had improved prognosis, and T3 was an independent prognostic factor with regard to UICC stage. Similarly, stroma subtypes were linked to distinct immunological features and metabolic pathways. Stroma subtype S4 had a better prognosis than S2. Subsequently, analyses based on an independent LUSC cohort treated by neoadjuvant therapy revealed that the S2 stroma subtype was associated with chemotherapy resistance. Clinically relevant patient subtypes as determined by tissue-based spatial metabolomics are a valuable addition to existing molecular classification systems. Metabolic differences among the subtypes and their associations with immunological features may contribute to the improvement of personalized therapy.",

            "description": "Accurate placenta pathology assessment is essential for managing maternal and newborn health, but the placenta's heterogeneity and temporal variability pose challenges for histology analysis. To address this issue, we developed the \u2018Histology Analysis Pipeline.PY\u2019 (HAPPY), a deep learning hierarchical method for quantifying the variability of cells and micro-anatomical tissue structures across placenta histology whole slide images. HAPPY differs from patch-based features or segmentation approaches by following an interpretable biological hierarchy, representing cells and cellular communities within tissues at a single-cell resolution across whole slide images. We present a set of quantitative metrics from healthy term placentas as a baseline for future assessments of placenta health and we show how these metrics deviate in placentas with clinically significant placental infarction. HAPPY\u2019s cell and tissue predictions closely replicate those from independent clinical experts and placental biology literature.",

Cells were mixed at the indicated ratios and tube formation assays were performed. NRASWT HDLECs showed well-regulated lumen structures and tube formation, but NRASQ61R HDLECs exhibited sheet-like proliferation and the formation of capillary-like structures was markedly less than that of NRASWT HDLECs. The higher the proportion of NRASQ61R HDLECs (fluorescent cells), the greater the sheet-like proliferation and the fewer the capillary-like structures.  2B: In the stepwise examination of NRASQ61R HDLEC mixtures, the covered area (occupied area by cellular components) (a), total nets (number of nets) (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) were analyzed by WinTube. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SD from triplicate wells. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, compared with 0%.  2C: Covered area (a), total nets (b), and tube length standard deviation (c) of NRASQ61R HDLECs with or without treatment were analyzed by WinTube. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SD from triplicate wells. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, compared with NRASQ61R HDLECs (no treatment).  2D: Microscopy images of tube formation of NRASQ61R HDLECs treated with mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (30 ng/ml) (a) and MEK inhibitor trametinib (30 ng/ml) (b).",

            "description": "Recently, a low-level somatic mutation in the NRAS gene (c.182 A > G, Q61R) was identified in various specimens from patients with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis. However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

However, it is unknown how these low-frequency mutated cells can affect the characterization and surrounding environment of their lesions. To understand the pathogenesis and association of these gene abnormalities, we established NRASQ61R mutated lymphatic endothelial cells transfected with lentivirus vector and undertook morphological and functional characterization, protein expression profiling, and metabolome analysis. NRASQ61R human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells showed poor tube formation, a low proliferation rate, and high migration ability with an increase in the ratio of mutated cells. An analysis of signaling pathways showed inactivation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway and hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway, which was improved by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment. This study shows the theoretical circumstances induced in vitro by NRASQ61R-mutated cells in the affected lesions of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis patients.",

            "description": "In Drosophila male gonads, niche-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has a role in maintaining stem cells in close proximity but the range of Dpp diffusion and its role has never been tested in the differentiating cells spaced one-cell layer away. Here, using genetically encoded nanobodies called Morphotraps, we physically block Dpp diffusion without interfering with niche-stem cell signaling and find that a diffusible fraction of Dpp is required to ensure differentiation of GSC daughter cells, opposite of its role in maintenance of GSC in the niche. Our work provides an example in which a soluble niche ligand induces opposed cellular responses in stem cells versus differentiating descendants to ensure spatial control of the niche, which may be a common mechanism to regulate tissue homeostasis.",

            "description": "The tight control of fate transitions during stem cell differentiation is essential for proper\ntissue development and maintenance. However, identifying how the multilayered regulation\nof gene expression programmes orchestrates stem cell differentiation in vivo remains\nelusive, because of the challenges in studying sparsely distributed adult stem cells in a\nsystematic manner. Here, we synchronised Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC)\ndifferentiation in vivo to perform in-depth transcriptome and translatome analyses at high\ndevelopmental resolution. This characterisation revealed widespread and dynamic changes\nin mRNA level, promoter usage, exon inclusion, and translation efficiency. Transient\nexpression of the master regulator, Bam, drives a first wave of expression changes, primarily\nmodifying the cell cycle programme. Surprisingly, as Bam levels recede, differentiating cells\nreturn to a remarkably stem cell-like transcription and translation programme, with a few\ncrucial changes feeding into a second phase driving terminal differentiation to form the\noocyte. Altogether, these findings reveal that rather than a unidirectional accumulation of\nchanges, the in vivo differentiation programme relies on distinctly regulated and\ndevelopmentally sequential waves.",

Z-stacks were exported from the ZEN lite (Zeiss) software as TIFF (no compression, all dimensions) first. In ImageJ, Z-stacks were converted to RGB and 8-bit. Correct scale was set (in \u00b5m) under \u2018Properties\u2019. Parameters that should be quantified were selected under \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u2018Set 3D Measurements\u2019. To perform the analysis, \u2018Plugins\u2019 - \u20183D Object Counter\u2019 - \u20183D object counter\u2019 was selected. Threshold for the intensity limit (areas below that limit were not considered for quantification) was set manually for every z-stack. Calculated values were further processed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Only size between 0,01-15 \u00b5m\u00b3 was considered. The reason for preferring manual versus automatic image adjustments is as follows: FIT NBs were numerous with varying size and signal intensity. We had found that a fixed threshold for intensity within the ImageJ software caused a loss of NBs when present but below the set threshold. To avoid this, manual inspection was preferred when using the ImageJ software to segment correctly."

            "description": "The functional importance of nuclear protein condensation remains often unclear. The bHLH FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) controls iron acquisition and growth in plants. Previously described C-terminal serine residues allow FIT to interact and form active transcription factor complexes with subgroup Ib bHLH factors such as bHLH039. FIT has lower nuclear mobility than mutant FITmSS271AA. Here, we show that FIT undergoes a light-inducible subnuclear partitioning into FIT nuclear bodies (NBs). Using quantitative and qualitative microscopy-based approaches, we characterized FIT NBs as condensates that were reversible and likely formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. FIT accumulated preferentially in NBs versus nucleoplasm when engaged in protein complexes with itself and with bHLH039. FITmSS271AA, instead, localized to NBs with different dynamics. FIT colocalized with splicing and light signaling NB markers. The NB-inducing light conditions were linked with active FIT and elevated FIT target gene expression in roots. FIT condensation may affect nuclear mobility and be relevant for integrating environmental and Fe nutrition signals.",

            "description": "The functional importance of nuclear protein condensation remains often unclear. The bHLH FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) controls iron acquisition and growth in plants. Previously described C-terminal serine residues allow FIT to interact and form active transcription factor complexes with subgroup Ib bHLH factors such as bHLH039. FIT has lower nuclear mobility than mutant FITmSS271AA. Here, we show that FIT undergoes a light-inducible subnuclear partitioning into FIT nuclear bodies (NBs). Using quantitative and qualitative microscopy-based approaches, we characterized FIT NBs as condensates that were reversible and likely formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. FIT accumulated preferentially in NBs versus nucleoplasm when engaged in protein complexes with itself and with bHLH039. FITmSS271AA, instead, localized to NBs with different dynamics. FIT colocalized with splicing and light signaling NB markers. The NB-inducing light conditions were linked with active FIT and elevated FIT target gene expression in roots. FIT condensation may affect nuclear mobility and be relevant for integrating environmental and Fe nutrition signals.",

            "release_date": "2024-01-22",
            "description": "Diabetes is caused by the inability of electrically coupled, functionally heterogeneous \u03b2-cells within the pancreatic islet to provide adequate insulin secretion. Functional networks have been used to represent synchronized oscillatory [Ca2+] dynamics and to study \u03b2-cell subpopulations, which play an important role in driving islet function. The mechanism by which highly synchronized \u03b2-cell subpopulations drive islet function is unclear. We used experimental and computational techniques to investigate the relationship between functional networks, structural (gap-junction) networks, and intrinsic \u03b2-cell dynamics in slow and fast oscillating islets. Highly synchronized subpopulations in the functional network were differentiated by intrinsic dynamics, including metabolic activity and KATP channel conductance, more than structural coupling. Consistent with this, intrinsic dynamics were more predictive of high synchronization in the islet functional network as compared to high levels of structural coupling. Finally, dysfunction of gap junctions, which can occur in diabetes, caused decreases in the efficiency and clustering of the functional network. These results indicate that intrinsic dynamics rather than structure drive connections in the functional network and highly synchronized subpopulations, but gap junctions are still essential for overall network efficiency. These findings deepen our interpretation of functional networks and the formation of functional sub-populations in dynamic tissues such as the islet.\u2003",

            "description": "During asymmetric cell division, cell polarity is coordinated with the cell cycle to allow proper inheritance of cell fate determinants and generation of cellular diversity. In the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) zygote, polarity is governed by evolutionarily conserved Partitioning (PAR) proteins that segregate to opposing cortical domains to specify asymmetric cell fates. Timely establishment of PAR domains requires a cell cycle kinase, Aurora A (AIR-1 in C. elegans). Aurora A depletion by RNAi causes a spectrum of phenotypes including reversed polarity,  excess posterior domains, and no posterior domain. How depletion of a single kinase can cause seemingly opposite phenotypes remains obscure. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system and drug treatments, we found that AIR-1 regulates polarity differently at different times of the cell cycle. During meiosis I, AIR-1 acts to prevent later formation of bipolar domains, while in meiosis II, AIR-1 is necessary to recruit PAR-2 onto the membrane. Together these data clarify the origin of multiple polarization phenotypes in RNAi experiments and reveal multiple roles of AIR-1 in coordinating PAR protein localization with cell cycle progression.

            "release_date": "2024-03-30",
            "description": "Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient needed in many metabolic processes. To balance needs and potential toxicity, plants control the amount of Fe they take up and allocate to leaves and seeds during their development. One important regulator of this process is POPEYE (PYE). PYE is a Fe deficiency-induced key bHLH transcription factor (TF) for allocation of internal Fe in plants. In the absence of PYE, there is altered Fe translocation and plants develop a leaf chlorosis. NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE4 (NAS4), FERRIC-REDUCTION OXIDASE3 (FRO3), and ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR1 (ZIF1) genes are expressed at higher level in pye-1 indicating that PYE represses these genes. PYE activity is controlled in a yet unknown manner. Here, we show that a small Fe deficiency-induced protein OLIVIA (OLV) can interact with PYE. OLV has a conserved C-terminal motif, that we named TGIYY. Through deletion mapping, we pinpointed that OLV TGIYY and several regions of PYE can be involved in the protein interaction. An OLV overexpressing (OX) mutant line exhibited an enhanced NAS4 gene expression. This was a mild Fe deficiency response phenotype that was related to PYE function. Leaf rosettes of olv mutants remained smaller than those of wild type, indicating that OLV promotes plant growth. Taken together, our study identified a small protein OLV as a candidate that may connect aspects of Fe homeostasis with regulation of leaf growth.",

In short, we developed an unbiased approach to profile the shape of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in Fiji 60. The \u03b1-actinin channel was utilized for segmentation. The workflow consisted of a pre-processing step in which the median filter was applied to the input images in order to reduce noise. Then, the images were segmented using the Li\u2019s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method. To avoid any bias in quantifying segmented cardiomyocytes between different treatments, we excluded all cropped cells that were on the images\u2019 edges. We also excluded segmented particles with an area smaller than 50000 pixels.\nTo quantify the changes in cell shape upon treatments, we utilized the minimum caliper diameter (MinFeret shape descriptor in Fiji), which measures the smallest diameter between any two points at the boundary of a segmented object. We also utilized the area of the segmented objects to visualize changes in cardiomyocytes\u2019 size upon different treatments. However, NRCMs in 2D culture acquire a variety of random shapes and sizes, and the diversity in the shapes and sizes were further greatly enhanced by the SF and NAC treatments, which also affected the identifications of contiguous cells\u2019 boundaries. This fact made it impossible to segment all individual cardiomyocytes, especially in the NAC treatment, where cells were hypertrophied and more intertwined. This problem was not even possible to resolve by manual curation of cells\u2019 borders or by staining the cytoplasmic membrane. As our interest was to quantify the changes in cell area and diameter between different treatments, we segmented connected cells as one object. We segmented 6 images from the control group, and 8 images from each of SF and NAC treatments. The segmentation resulted in 123-196 objects per image. For each object of each image, we computed the area and minimum diameter. To plot them, we pooled the measures of each condition together. Pooling them resulted in groups of values, in which each value originated from one image (6 for the control condition,8 for NAC and 8 for SF treatments). Then we calculated the average of each group. This resulted in 148 objects in the control condition, 144 objects in the NAC treatment, and 196 objects in the SF treatment as shown in the Source Data File. These averaged values of the segmented objects\u2019 area and MinFeret were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The implemented image analysis pipeline is available in Github (https://github.com/BIIFSweden/CellGeometryProfiling)."

            "description": "Redox homeostasis modulates the morphology of cardiomyocytes\nRedox homeostasis is affected in heart failure. Remodelling of heart failure has been associated with enhanced ROS production due to alterations in the excitation-contraction coupling, or due to altered cytoplasmic calcium handling (M\u00fcnzel, Gori et al. 2015). However, these alterations are met by adaptations of the antioxidative system to restore redox homeostasis. We have noted that redox induces changes to cardiomyocytes geometry, where oxidative stress induces cardiomyocytes\u2019 elongation and atrophy, while antioxidative compounds promotes cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. These alterations in the cardiomyocyte\u2019s geometry resemble the changes observed to geometry of the heart during heart failure and indicate that intracellular redox homeostasis is involved in regulating the morphology of cardiomyocytes. We quantitatively measured these alterations in cell morphology upon treating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with a pro-oxidant (Sulforaphane, SF) and an antioxidant (N-Acetyl Cysteine, NAC). We utilized florescence microscopic imaging, followed by image analysis with ImageJ. This experiment is part of a study that investigates the impact of endogenous antioxidative defenses in the heart and the potentially adverse effects associated with excessive quenching of physiological levels of reactive oxygen species, which act as cellular signalling molecules. The study is now available as a pre-pint on BioRxiv (Epigenetic modulators link mitochondrial redox homeostasis to cardiac function a sex-dependent manner, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.26.485908), and under consideration for publication in Nature Communications.",
